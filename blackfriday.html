<p>I have ownership in the brands I use.This way I&#8217;m making money even when I&#8217;m spending money. As we enter our 13th straight hour of shopping, mom and I have 1 MAYBE 2 stops left. I would rather pay hundreds more than go through the ridiculousness of Black Friday. A bit of both, I think. I finally decide to buy a TV and before it gets to the basket it is temporarily out of stock. I can only do so much shopping. Is it just me, or does Brett Bielema look more svelte in a black track suit?</p>

<p>I&#8217;d rather be the Kid with one leg then scrap with a 15 stone woman over a pair of frenchies. the only thing I bought today was chipotle. I survived! Merry Christmas to me. I WILL NEVER FOLD ANOTHER PAIR OF JEANS OR THERMAL TEES AGAIN. Please tell me that&#8217;s not a&#8217; thing&#8217; in the UK now?! This overwrought orchestral Christmas music is killing me. Not me. Can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m about to do this. BEN MOSS JEWELLERS is the company I endorse.</p>

<p>I would rather pay full price 2 not deal with crowds. My mom just asked if I wanted to come to the mall with her then I&#8217;m like sure wait.. Who would&#8217;ve thought that I heard the most fighting and F words at Hobby Lobby.. Feeling relieved, my iPad battery died just as my wife was looking to order a new sofa and armchair in Laura Ashley sale. Can&#8217;t wait to get my shop on tomorrow. Bank account isn&#8217;t nearly as empty as I thought it would be. What I wanna know is why soooooo many people needed TVs today?!? I&#8217;d say thats a win.</p>

<p>I forgot to tape the pic to my wife&#8217;s purse. Gutted I missed it! At my house. One black friday shift is enough, WHY am I scheduled for two at the same job? I want to read the freshly posted reviews of all the cheap, awful and frankly haneous TV&#8217;s that were purchased today. I saw all of those shopping bags! them : &quot;I&#8217;m done buying gifts for my family and friends! Already got my babes their gifts and I wanna give them them now!!! I honestly think people view Black Friday as a sport.</p>

<p>Wondering if I could get one for &quot;Best Director. I am black every Friday. I am one happy girl! I LITERALLY ALMOST DIED WHILE GOING SHOPPING, NOT COOL. Have an awesome time with my mom shopping and eating at cracker barrel.</p>
