# You Can't Write If You Can't Relate #

## Chapter 1 ##

Might quit while I'm ahead. Con : Boyfriend's going to stop me from writing' til sunday. I was looking for 40K this weekend but I seem to have lost it under a carpet. Haha, I'm approaching 3,000 for today and I'm realizing that 8,000 isn't feasible at all.

I need a breakthrough or something. I'm not a competitive person, but give me 30 days to write 50k, and a list of opponents... Can I do it? Somehow I'm already 607 words away from hitting 15k. Have i finally managed to get out of my slump and go towards the action?

But I'm going to, because I'm a fucking professional. Nawww lookkit my Main Character being all mature and shit! Above and beyond my personal goal : just hit 25.1k! Going to end up relying on Thanksgiving leftovers to power me through at the end. Managed to get my daily target WC in before midnight. Now I get to go do some yoga and catch up on Agents of Shield!

I'm trying to hit 25,000 tomorrow in order to catch up. I've got to speed up if want to finish! why do I suddenly have the maturity level of an eight year old?

Finally I like it! Have recovered from nauseating headache (I think). I will try for 50K by the end of this week. Conceivably, I could do 100K at this rate.

Ah, but now I knew. I couldn't concentrate on writing so I thought COFFEE but now I think it was because I was already too hyper... The break came SEVEN words before I finally would have passed 25K! I doubt I could write professionally as the deadlines would turn me into a monster.

I have somehow managed to keep up with my word count though. I think I can do it! Daughter is now taking a bubble bath while I try to write. Just lost about 1k of my word count, which means I had duplication in my "complete" file.

Yeah my mama she told me don't worry about your edits... Not looking forward to one that I know takes place later on. Hell, maybe I can finish all 50k this weekend. I lured him outside with bits of granola bar. I am pleasantly surprised.

Hit 35k while I did it. I still have to catch up from missed days with the migraine. But, I've written myself into these 3 characters being together. As I said, names are TBD, so far I have Jane, Janet, John, Joe, Jamie, James, Jeremy, and Cadence.

Just another 3.5k words left today to reach my target. I haven't heard much about it and I'm still not ready to participate. I've reached that point where I have to organize my notes and fix my outline. " Maybe it's the old Purloined Letter trick daring us to spot it like saying are you on my same brainwave?

I had a crisis during my writing time and then life happened. I just wrote 1377 words in 15 minutes. I hit the halfway mark, and I finished ch. Think I'll choose drawing. I've just been so busy...

Thank you brain for working while I slept. I am DOING it! I've written 3103 words so far tonight.

I got my 25,000 words badge. Yay I've hit the word count for today, 28,333. I had a habbit of skipping a set up. I'm hoping tons and tons? So far I have Sumerian, Sanskrit, Latin, HIndi, Welsh, and Arabic influenced names in my novel.

I'm just over 10,000 words away. So I gotta catch up tomorrow! I wrote NOTHING. Don't stop me Smee. I have 39k so far.

Yet, I have 22k to go. Alright, the coffee conundrum has been resolved, now I have a 15 mins break. Let's see if I can get to 50k by the end of the day. Going to pretend I'm writing Groundhog Day and just copy and paste the whole thing a second time.

Well, I've taken a break....so maybe it's time to get back to writing? I'm at 1,341 words for the day so far. I'm used to writing then editing a short story. " Since you obviously don't speak girl, "Maddy says," let me translate for you. Now I feel like I should just keep writing anyway but I need to be up early tomorrow...

Basically I'm writing about writing. I made it! I've managed 3,743 words today and we're officially on our way to hell. Not even nearly there, but I'm optimistic.

I could write 500 words and hit 45k, or I could shower and start planning my next novel... can I leave the EoSR with 25k? I caught up! I wanted to finish early as well, but who knows?

Finished my freelancing project for today. I started off just' building a busy day buffer'. Suddenly, I wish I had a cat. Tonight I started at 44,019 and am ending at 46,029. I'm getting started on my writing. I should be going for halfway but given the exhaustion and frustration of my life...5k beats giving up completely.

It's like I've crossed the event horizon, and I can't make my way back. She has memory problems, so I don't think she knows. Bye bye wifi, I need to disconnect you or I'll just procrastinate alllllll day when I could be writing my novel. It was my lowest word count so far.

I wrote 5k without checking my word count. Partly because of home issues, partly because the YA idea I had needs help with the voice. I think my main character just fell in love with the wrong person.

Just passed the 35000 word mark on my novel in progress. Worked for Sidney Sheldon, who I am paraphrasing. I make that a promise to myself! I'm up to 657 words so far.

This year I have 1 who is a complete mystery. " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! It's that time of year when I am always either checking my twitter, eating candy, or writing. I AM SUCH A SLACKER. Stopping at 10,189 words, exceeded the count for the day, even if I haven't begun to catch up.

Whatever, it works toward my word count now. 5K in four hours might be a stretch, but I'm going to try. So with tears in my eyes and Blackbird in my head I'm going to write. I think I'll try topping 30K after sunrise. One day I'm going to spell reminiscent correct the first time round. I'm at 25,783 so far.

I think there was coffee??? basketball is my life. It took 45 minutes by I am now caught up and HALFWAY! So far, I'm plugging along at 34,511 words.

Can I reach 14,000 today? Not that I'm anywhere near halfway done with my novel. I should be around 23k today but I'm stuck on 21.6k. I probably should have started writing today before now. On second though, I think I'm going to write just a little more and take a nap.

Realizing at 16,000 words in that I have to rework my entire outline? I am 2,500 words from 50k. Getting to my word count goal was so hard today, but I made it : D. Actually got in a couple things I liked.

This has not been my month. Now that all of twitter knows I won't feel intimidated and back out cause then I'd feel like a loser! I'm sipping wine and reading a book. Until later :) I'm going to procrastinate a little.

Instead I'm on twitter. Now I'm mobile!! (I can totally relate to my character.) " And besides, if I were there when she came back out, she would have certainly started asking questions.

I dunno that I'm a pure math class sees me outside the art of... I just almost wrote NaNoWriMo instead of November in my notebook for the date. Now I have to go peel some eggs.

If I write 9k today I'll be completely caught up. And I'm halfway done!! But I am using November to start my second novel, codenamed "The Forest of Eternal Youth" I'll be doing the word thang. Shame about my wrists though...

Words are starting to flow out more easily, though I just hit a particularly sad turning point for MC. I don't know how I'm supposed to get him and his car home. Hi ho hi ho it's off to plot I go. But I did and got over the 1667.

I need words. The guilt stops me. When has my life become so Rock'n'Roll? I can manage 1000 words a day, but for some reason, more than that really starts to drag me down.

Teen because I write crappy like one. I need at least 3 more days like today to catch up. I need 13,328 words to make it to the halfway point. Since the last tweet I wrote 825 words of Fanfiction! I'm still behind but am a lot closer to winning now!

Maybe I'll have a new story ready in time for next year' s. Friday night and I'm at World Coffee writing. Remember those 47 words I was expanding yesterday? Wondering if I could reach 50k today...

I BELIEVE. However, it does seem to be 25077 words of total poop, so I may need to take the next year to edit. I achived my daily goal. Had to meet my word quota for today and I did. I'd get more words in if I didn't insist on handwriting everything down initially.

I wish my derriere was big so I didn't have to work on my novel. I'm eating Pudding with a fork. Finally broke 10K on my novel this month! And now I'm closing my browser and I'm gonna write. " Apparently I can't think of foul enough language when I'm typing fast.

I need a variation of Tellervo. I don't know if I'll do any more, but I'm slowly getting caught up! Don't tell me if it's the last one, I'm a giant baby. I almost dropped one of my major plot points today because I just couldn't make it work.

Time to get another 2k in on my novel. I'm at 2,609 for the day. I need some cheerleaders! I have written past the daily wordcount goal today, but still got a lot of catching up to do.

Hurts my elbows. Will be looking for a few sets of eyes to beta read the first chapter of my novella soon! " "Nothing, my dear Frodo. Also my heroine totally did something that surprised me!

I may still be behind on my writing, but I just surpassed 15k words, and it felt pretty damn satisfying, if I do say so meself. Somehow I managed 1,705 words today!! I can do this. I feel like it would help if I had a title for this book, but it always takes me forever.

I find it funny and quite amusing how songs just randomly pop into my head while writing. In any case, I am almost done what will probably be the longest story in the collection. I keep forgetting I'm doing 3k a day instead of 2.5. Well, I didn't see that coming.

Will I try? I need to continue writing. Instead I have to go to work. Probably the last time I'll do that until my first novel comes out in early 2015.

Tummy is full of sushi, I'm back in my pjs, let's finish this fight scene from earlier this morning. She sounds like my daughter. I'm so not in the mood to write. At this rate, I'll be done in six days. I have no clue.

Still have the afternoon ahead of me. I am when writing 11.65 words away from one word a second. I've got stuff to take care of today. I have a recurring nightmare that Waylon comes home from work early and discovers I live in squalor from 6AM to 5PM.

For me?!? Oh by the powers vested in me... I wrote 957 words in 30 minutes with Write or Die! Mapping out chapters instead of just seeing where the story takes me. Still a bit behind but I can easily catch up at this rate. Hit 20K words finally, which means I have 30K left to write, still a bit behind but happy for what I've accomplished.

It's still early on a Friday night and I have to live. 30K is begging for me to make it. I will never skip a day again. or I guess their body count?

We have a love hate relationship and right now, I love you. I am DOING it! Also, trying to find my gloves and my car keys... Yay me! Why am I so inspired by anything except what I should be writing?

Word count down the drain as I attack huge blocks of text. With that I do believe I have crossed the 30k threshold. " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! I am DOING it!

Who's with me? I'm a history major. I've totally got this. I started this section of the book where a major event was supposed to happen.

Writing all by my lonesome this evening. Have written 4600 words today (not all on my Nano project). I'd really like to get back to my poetry, but I guess I'll finish this dumb thing first. And I told myself I was going to do this today... I think that's a record for me. I might be plotting things for the midway party on the 16th... I've caught up to the rest of the world. I'M NOT, I WON'T!

I know I'm often not sure while writing, but this time, it feels more so. Planning to write some scenes out of order just because they are in my head now! I'm at 29,000 words now! I'll take it.

FOUR WEDDINGS has given me an idea for a scene. Noooo computer don't die, I'm almost done writing! Hopefully I can catch up soon... I have my tea back! Not sure Gorgon City is the right music for this row I've been avoiding. I never had "Siri" before on my old phone!

On track to break my goal of 100,000 words this month. I made ca. So back I go... Finally broke my writers block! Sometimes I feel like the only thing I'm good at is pushing through on difficult writing days.

Just wish they could fall into my head in the daytime. I'll sleep on it and finish tmrw! Officially my highest word count so far!

I am writing a book at midnight. I think I'm doing alright. I wish I could just stop. I almost got 2,000 words in today! The MOST far behind I've EVER been...

If I write 1000 words every day, I make wordcount. 2,213 words so far today, bringing me to 27,677. I'm protective over my art. I have so earned another coffee. Hit 30,000 words and I'm feeling pretty low...

Let me count the ways, 1, 2, 3 oh look, Twitter! Check my FB 5songs for others. I've never came this far before, i'm freaking out. Can't seem to silence the editor in me. Even tho my dad died Nov 6, doing funeral stuff,family I just gotta write the novel. Still on track and I think I have the major plot points worked out to the end.

I'm not in love with my novel and I keep emotionally cheating on it with all the other novels I could be writing instead. I feel like it's eating my life. I need some adderall.

Confession : I dislike writing dialogue. Some nights I only wrote 200 words. And I NEED to read this book. Tell me how far you've come!

23,355 for the month so far, which means I'm on target! Without my permission, I swear! I've had a couple of 2k days and I'm almost caught up! I'm hoping to make up for it by reaching the 40k mark tomorrow.

I reached my goal of writing 5k today. Things I'm good at writing : dialogue, descriptions of weird things, the middle bits of stories. Where did I put my blinders? Just wanted to say a big thanks to all who started following me this week.

This song revolves around my NaNoWriMo story. I am a masochist. Nearly 18,000 words toward my NaNoWriMo novel!

I am DOING it! I'm finishing a WIP and then moving on to something else. " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! Wrote nearly 4,000 words today, in spite of all of my distractions on Twitter!

Except I called it a forum, so nonline people get it too. I have a feeling the word count is about to be easier than ever to achieve! I just wrote a scene that I KNOW will get completely cut out during the revisions. I need a spring buddy! Oh my God Becky, look at her word count. I have to, there is no other option.




## Chapter 2 ##

Word sprints are in my future! I've dragged myself up to 10,500 words which isn't great but beginning to warm to it now. Wanted to to 2.5K again but am losing my temper. I just wrote 6,000 words today, and I'm still not caught up! I hit just over 30,000 words on the new novel today.

" How fast do I have to run? still behind but I'm catching up. But I'm writing. Sooo, 292 on THAT sprint, but I finished a scene and didn't know how to start the next... After 7.7k I caught up!

Gonna hit 50K words if it kills me! I just can't make myself write! I think I just broke a personal record. Sometimes I look at this outline and think "you people are going to hate me for this in the best way. I really needed to hear this.

I've really found my groove. When I finally get all my words in the same document, it's gonna be a total mess, and I'm scared of disaster clean up. While I let that sink in, gonna make some play money. But the words amuse me!

I had a crisis during my writing time and then life happened. With all of the new ideas I've got, I've come to the conclusion that I'm not a genre writer.

I think i took on too much this month. Slowly but surely I'm getting there. I'm only up to 7,800 words. " "Nothing, my dear Frodo. That'll work for my universe...

Because I am always facetious. I'm kind of behind. I need coffee. Didn't write much as I hoped.

I'm shooting for 3K today. Writing romance makes me feel extremely uncomfortable (in a good way). The word "chortled" sticks out like a sore thumb to me. It's a miracle I got that much done.

I need 2522 words per day 15 days would be 37,830. I think I might be writing a short story right now, possible novella. Gonna hit 25k tonight if it kills me. 1000 words left to write for today, and hopefully I can get it done before 11. I write for NaNo at night so I can, so I can Watch my word count climb to brand new heights.

I can't find it anywhere. I already finished my 50K word first draft of my novel...2 weeks early. Every day I expect to see George R. R. Martin logging into the NaNo forums and saying, "Help! I am over halfway through my novel!! How much do you guys think I can write while I'm at work?

I WISH I could remember how I imagined this conversation this morning. Before you chain me to the computer like a slave again... I even had a chance to be social this weekend. Was about to fall asleep when a really important plot point in my novel finally came together.

Which is absolutely NUTS for me. One of my favorite issues of the past year! I have! (My goal is 15k by the end of today, but maybe I should increase it...) I'd have to write 5500 words today to get caught up.

To catch up to the 25,000 mark, I need 10,042 words. Can you give me some words? BUT HOW ELSE CAN I WRITE??? I have a lot of catching up to do because I was already behind. Won't try to annoy you guys too much with reminders of my contest.

Do I sleep or do I write? Why does it take me four hours to write 1K words if I start at 9 a.m. and only an hour if I start at midnight? I sense a major rewrite in my future. I was proud to represent District 5 at the Lust Game.

Well, that explains my sudden otherwise irrational phobia of shovels. i need someone to motivate me. I really need someone to bring me a Peppermint Mocha from Starbucks.

I'm about to faceplant into my computer. Now's what I'm talking about. Then I figured out how I could fit this with an earlier plot bunny about finding a lost dog and it just works.

Today I'm going to put a dent in the word count. I have a new book started. I said I couldn't break 100,000 this weekend but it is looking feasible!! That is a number I can live with now it's time to sleep.

Coffee and then I'll start writing for real? ' It took me far too long to figure out why Microsoft Word had it underlined... I have the energy of a dishrag soaked in Valium. I feel like I should be screaming, "IT'S ALIIIIIIVE!

Need to do some further chapter plans tomorrow I think. I am going to bed. Thank you for all the support I'm getting out in Nanoland! Looking at what I'm going to write today and lulzing at myself. If this story makes it to 50,000 words, I'll be surprised. But I really really really want to hit 25k.

Does anyone know if I'm allowed to mention brand names in my book? I'm thinking of keeping word count challenges year round for friendly competition. The one I started in November 2012 but still! I can't believe how fast it's going.

I have my whole weekend planned to be caught up by Sunday, Monday tops. " "Nothing, my dear Frodo. I think it helped me find out about Marcie and her mother.

Titled my novel today! I managed just under 1800 words tonight. Tomorrow is a big writing day for me! Finished my novel, starting a new one from almost scratch! Sometimes, it triggers "real" movie in my head.

Word count is over 33K and I feel accomplished. nano helps to push me. 15 minute WARNING my Wordlings.

It concerns me a bit, but I'm not behind, so that's a plus. I've had a cocktail, you see. Got my tea, my laptop, and my chocolate.

The words, they elude me! So I'm doing something to try to sort it out. Barely hit my daily word count Sunday to reach 33.3K, but it's progress. I think I was typing too fast.

So, I just need to spend about eight hours writing tomorrow in order to get caught up. " He texted : "Love you to" So I sent : "Too" Seriously, I couldn't help it. I'm hooked! I might just have to go for it and finish 50,000 by tomorrow. At this rate, I might finish my new scenes and revisions by...

I just reached 30000 words. I didn't hit 10k tonight, but 8k ain't too shabby. Writing fiction always leads me to listen to whatever music my characters might be listening to. And follow me! 25,645 is my word count so far. I didn't realize how much time has passed I was so in the zone.

Which character will slubber I wonder. And my characters have only just left the first town. " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! She sounds like my daughter. Lesson planning for the week is finished so now all my free time can be spent writing!

Don't think I can finish. No work for me today! Time to hide from the rain with a hot chocolate and a few hundred words of my novel. Now how to get from one scene to the scene I eventually really need to be at...

I got to 28,821 words yesterday, so I technically don't HAVE to write today, but I can't let this writer's block fester! I'm almost at 20,000!!!! this is way more brutal than I thought it'd be, but I'm really proud of my consistency this year.

I'll catch you. AND I did HOMEWORK. forgot that I've written so much today bc I've been squeezing in bits in pieces all day.

I'm just along for the ride. " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! This weekend a stayover friend is going to occupy my son. Now that my school musical is over, my main focus is going to be writing. I really have lost my way...

Anyone seen my motivation today? And, that's all my head can take today. I had so much to do.

" MC : "Are you talking about me or the bed? I like this book too much to leave it alone. " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! Within the next hour, I shall hit and pass the halfway mark! Maybe I'll start a nrw story. I really want a snack.

It's working out for me. Finally hit my daily word count goal for this first time this month. Now I have purpose. ...and I will marry very well some day, just like her.

I wrote sixty words. I know what i want to write I just can't get it out. Now to figure out if I can do Book 3 in this month as well! And my two main characters totally just kissed "in their dreams". I'm ready to write some words.

I wish I had already written all that stuff that is jumping around in my head. I could get a lot done in 2.5 hours. That means I'm officially caught up. I made the 30,000 word mark and am currently in need of some motivation, preferably in the form of licorice. Hubby came home from work early so I could write. Thanks for helping me try.

Will just have to redouble my efforts tomorrow. A BEAST I TELL YOU!!! At 35,541 words and I get to reintroduce a character that was briefly in another book. I wasn't expecting to hit this major event so early. I'm being very antisocial and writing during breaks and stuff.

Or is that just me? Surpassed my daily goal with 1786, but I still have a little catching up to do. I somehow managed to reach my word count for today after getting no sleep last night and running around all day. Just hit 10,000 for the second time...which is halfway to where I should be right now.

I don't think I'm going to finish the scene before I have to leave. Man, I need a nap. I'm not proud about my word count, but I'm proud about not having given up.

And that's what I do. Good thing I got ahead yesterday, sick husband today so I didn't get much writing done! So close I can taste it! I can do it! Right, time to see how much further I can get.

I've written 6K today and am NOT stopping until I hit 40K. New record and now my brain is mush. I went from, "I don't want to write tonight," to "I wrote 2,400 words. He'll thank me later, right?

488 words until I reach the day 16 target. I hope the second half goes as smoothly. I can't wait to start editing. Who wants to join me for a word sprint in 8 minutes?

I am so ready for bed... three pages of my two main characters discussing why aliens wear clothes and if they have naughty bits. Suddenly, I feel like I can reach my protagonist. I just used Uff da in my novel.

I'm going home. 12k on my novel. San Francisco here I come! I don't mean to alarm anyone, but I reached 50k at 6:50am mountain standard time. Fourteen days and 21,846 words in and the story has changed so much since I planned it.

I really didn't feel like writing, had to push myself. It's really a miracle that I've lasted this long. Hear me roar. I don't know if I can do it... And I write for NaNo at night, so I can, so I can Keep track of plot lines in my mind.

OMG kill me. 1k before I get a cup of coffee? When I don't like a section, it's because I've either said too little or too much. I guess writing happens when it wants to happen...?

I can't decide what to do. I don't regret this decision. I had a lot on my plate, so I didn't get as much done as a I wanted.

I'll try for 5,000 though. Pausing in my current crawl to eat lunch. I think I can, I think I can, I think I can. Ending my second night on 8,689 words. I really need to get up earlier or something to get a jumpstart on this. Who wants to sprint with me?

Tonight I'm heading to a write in. Add me peeps! Realized today that with 31k under my belt so far this is the longest single piece of fiction I've ever written solo! When I acquired this bacteria that took up real estate in my respiratory system, I simultaneously lost ALL motivation.

I need to ruin my protagonists lifes. I am DOING it! I've got this. No, I'm not doing any of that. I prefer loud rock music. Left it at a scene I'll enjoy writing tomorrow.

What am I? The Packers won and I just had a burst of energy, busting through 30,000 words. That 25k badge coming up is my only motivation right now.

Hanging out on twitter, and not working on my words. " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! Feeling really tearful as I am taking the little boy character back to his home in Ancient Britain via a time traveling boat! Have just realised that my fic isn't going to go the whole 50k.

I still haven't learned to turn Facebook off when I try to write. Considering I missed the first half for work, I'm pleased at how the mid month marathon went! " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days. After a night of nightmares and plotbunnies, I'm considering abandoning NaNo2 and go play with the new bunnies.

I think this calls for some cake, yes? Yea, though I work through the rough first draft, I will fear no trolling, for words are with me. I can't wait to hear what you think of it. I am writing so much every day that the November dates seem to creep forward.

And I won't even be that after the clock strikes midnight. This tale's got control of me. The end is in sight, but I'd really rather have a nap.

It looks like I'm working tommorow. One of my chs used paleography and hist bib to work out where the mysterious book had come from... I' ll. I don't think I'm getting much writing done today.

I feel your pain. I'm pretty sure 1500 words in less than an hour is a new record for me. Oh my gosh!!! Need Jaz to take a loooong nap today so I can write!! I'm ready to write some words.

Each day I decide if this is the day I take off. I successfully tricked myself into writing 4000 words today, so I am only a day and a half behind! I just had a really good idea for my novel but if I did it I would be forced to write a sequel. I'm writing at : 30. I see you, finish line, and I'm comin for ya. I've cracked 30,000 words on my new novel.

Getting my writing groove back. I'm excited, I think I'm finally understanding one of my main characters. Holy shnikes, an even 43k in my master file. Somebody go out and buy me a candy bar. I just can't decide if this is a real problem or not.

No word wars for me tonight. Wrote another 3.5k for my new novel yesterday. Do I ruin my childhood memories by googling what they look like now? an hour of genius brainstorming and stream of consciousness has put new life into my story.

" I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! It always turns out fine and yet I put it off as long as I can. I had to make up for falling short yesterday. I will make it to 50000 words. Who wants to do a 40 min writing sprint with me at 7:30pm?

" I have no sense of time, but in November I always know what day it is. It uploaded on my phone yesterday, but never showed up on the internet. But the responsible part of me says I should write words.




## Chapter 3 ##

I'll take it. I'm in a shame spiral with my writing today. Uh oh, I'm finally hitting the writers block. I passed 40K today! And my brain.

Otherwise I might weep. Because I cut myself and had to bleed. I can't write....I am out of ideas....help? I hit 100K! Passed 13k words, so over a quarter of the way through at last (when I should be halfway tho).

Starting to rub out of steam, but I know the story well from the point I just wrote on. Ugh. No idea where I even found the strength for that session.

" I shooky my head "and" balzer "instead of blazer. Maybe I should do that sometime before the end of the month. Any writers want to sprint with me now? And I'm still not done with my story!

Might have to have my cookies as a bribe to keep going rather than a reward. My novel just turned into a thriller like I wanted, but couldn't manage! And my time. I need motivation to write.

Going were the storytelling takes me. (have I said month a lot in this tweet?) 2000 of my words didn't save last night. The 1K words I wrote yesterday, might be the biggest breakthrough I've had in over a year. I did, it, clan!

Let's see if I can bang out another 1500. Just read next scene in my plan. I've decided November will my month of decadent indulgence. Just my tea and me...and my novel!

I am DOING it! The tension is killing me. I'm trying to matter. " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days!

I am the slowest! wish me luck! I'd like to have a 10k weekend. I will double my word count by Monday.

Woke up thinking about my MS Blood Vision. If I write another 520 words before going to bed, that'll be a 5K day. So tickled with myself and my Gilda. Now, hopefully, I can catch up today. These twelve hour days at work are hurting my word count.

After today I should be ahead enough that I can take the holidays of Dragon Age and Thanksgiving off! You know what, I've written enough that if I wrote nothing tomorrow I'd still be on track to finish. I put yellow Do Not Cross police tape around today. I made this guy in novel drive somewhere and then drink.

Remember that dance party I was going to treat myself to last week? maybe I should do some writing? Total word count : 25116 I'm now over halfway! added another 4k to my word count today.

no grungy diner yet, but just give me time. Also, I've initiated a mystery to which there is literally no solution. I will not rest until I hit 20K.

So I know what to do with Luke. I'm so sleepy. Well, I have given myself quite some pickles to sort out in this story. I woke up today with an urge to lie in bed all day and write.

At 9,051 words for today and 21,118 words total, I'm officially caught up! I wrote the word' funnest. I'll take it. Now I know. Last year I had to write 8K words on the November 30th.

You think I should go for 22k before I go off for tonight? I don't know why, but every word feels like a struggle tonight. I've settled on calling the town Brownwell's Burrow for now after it's founder Cecil Bronwell. I won't give up! Just realised I now have 25k written!

as of 11.59pm tonight I'm supposed to be on 25k. I'm not sure what to do with a first draft that's not begging to be written. And I'm knitting again instead of writing. Cannot think of how to write this scene, so I'm going to catch up on Sailor Moon Crystal and have lunch.




## Chapter 6 ##

If I kill one of my characters, will the rest of them become more cooperative? I am one full day ahead and HALFWAY DONE! Which means, for the first time this month, I'm on par for 150k by the end of the month! I really want to write some more later today. Encouraging myself by wearing my new Wonder Woman onesie to write.

okay folks, I'm doing a 1k30min. I need to write more. This being true, I've raised procrastination to an art form. ONLY 800 MORE WORDS UNTIL I MEET MY FIRST GOAL! I'm ready to polish your manuscript. I was needing a new twist and that may just be what I was looking for.

I am starting to love what I am writing, but unearthing all this is making me crave talk therapy...or whiskey. I'd love to promote your book for free! The first thousand after the 10k milestones are always the hardest for me. I think I'm in love with it.

Oh, man, I just noticed my first plot hole... I am now a full 2 days ahead! I'm back up to date, and I could do more but real life is calling me back! I'm really feeling like I need some light weight entertainment. I'd love to promote your book for free!

I have a better routine during the work week. The sass is so strong with my Micaela. 3969 words so far today and I feel I can still write more. Good result considering how I couldn't write the past two days. To be clear I'm not finished the story yet I just reached 50k!

I love the voice of your site. Still going strong in my quest for 5k tonight. Okay, at this point I think I'm just putting off writing because I know the end is near. I think I'm hitting a major turning point in my story :) Are you liking yours so far? Had a brief hitch just before halfway, like I usually do, but I'm still enjoying my novel!

Really didn't want to write tonight, but my goal has been to stay ahead! Sometimes, I think Aleia will make a great Queen, but she would sacrifice 1 life to save a whole city without thought. Ok so I didn't quite make it to 25000 last night, fell asleep at 3am! The cute server at my fave writing pub has just arrived.

Not my best in terms of daily word count but I'm finally getting my groove back. I'm just going to write and write and write some more. I know a one hour nap, so I'm ready to write all night! A Noveltini and witty banter await me...

I'm at 32k so definitely will make 50k but don't know if I will finish the whole novel in November! I guess writing happens when it wants to happen...? Also happy to report that I FINALLY broke 10,000 words last night! Cool idea I think. Maybe I can beat my personal best and get 6k written today. I would love to tell your story.

I just had an exciting jail break with explosions. Okay, inspiration is smacking me right on the lips, it's time to go for it! Maybe I'm inspired to add a few more... Enjoying what I'm doing with my NaNo.

Tomorrow is the day that I will be writing and writing and writing and more writing. And I'm having so much fun, too! Okay, lemme go do my hair and come back. I have an hour and forty minutes left before having to get ready for work.

Let my fingers overcome my creative lapses. I'm pretty sure cookies will boost my word count. My novel is meandering because I can't create the plot as fast as I can type! There's a possibility my characters need to stop getting ready now and actually get to the party they're going to...

I don't think I' mma push myself any more tonight. I write too many sex scenes for this to qualify as a YA novel. I think that's good enough. Ready for my writing day tomorrow! I did not accomplish as much homework as I wish I would have. I'm surprised my face isn't burning.

I'm going to have FUN. 14,635 total words, and I think it is safe to say that this writing night has been beyond successful. Maybe I'm inspired to add a few more... A lot of my drafting process might be injecting more character into my MC.

Made me laugh and dive into my work. Today, I discovered the magical power my character has. Not hit my personal quota for the day yet, but I've hit the website's calculations for catching up. Thanks to the WRiMOS computer, I'm up to 35,000 words and I can finally sleep. I ran out of fun sized kit kats. I should be able to hit 25k by Sunday without a problem.

I'm around 23K, not as far as I'd like, but family has been keeping me busy this week. I'm about ready to throw in the towel. I declare this day a success. I'll be fine. Twitter as much as I love you I am putting you away for a while.

Ah, how I love late night writing. But I'm ready to go again. I ran out of fun sized kit kats. I think I may be more in love with the love interest in my story than my main character is. I love truly wicked characters.

I feel like the baddies need more page time in my WIP. Here's a fun experiment : I have no idea what this scene will accomplish or how it will play out, but I'm just gonna press PLAY. I have 5k words so far.

If you're stumped, ask yourself,' What inspired me in the first place? If I don't do that again I'll be fine. Thought I only had 24K words but really am at 28K!! I didn't get many pictures but basically Night Of Writing Dangerously was awesome! I plan on doing nanowrimo once and winning once.

I've forgotten to add most of the quirky quirks I assigned to my characters. It's more challenging for me to reveal through dialogue than to reveal through narration. Speaking of discipline, I wrote a grand total of 53 words today. I'm beat, but I'm glad I made it through.

Finished my first NaNo story at 40,851 words. I'll be starting my first 5k word sprint in about 10 minutes! Determination has now put me at 2,800 words written today, and more tomorrow.

I so don't feel safe at work today. Halfway to my own personal goal! AND my MC is embracing her truly epic self.

Not that I'm anywhere near halfway done with my novel. So much writing to do, but do I get a day off soon. Every time I write a scene where a couple I ship fights or breaks up I get kind of emotional. I won't finish a ms this month, but it is really helping me more disciplined in committing to write! Better walk in with an outline so I make the most of my time.

Sometimes I am so stoked about this story and others I am completely bummed about it. I'm ready to write some words. I swear it felt like far more than the minimum this time as I was doing it, though. Heading into a weekend of major writing, my kind of weekend! Now I can write better.

I've written 6000 words today, and am nearly up to where where I need to be. If only I was as inventive as a writer as I am when finding ways to procrastinate. Another 800 and I'll by at the 15k mark, which seems significant. How many words can I write today?

Not quite as much as I'd wanted, but DAMN WELL CLOSE ENOUGH FUCKITY BYE. Writing deadline looming, but I had this sudden urge to clean off my desk. This is my' get ready' tweet cuz tweeting costs me a minute of my life! I'm pretty sure the words I am writing right now don't make sense. It's come to my attention just how much I love the night. Not writing this story that has been in my mind for almost 10 years or more.

I was too far into my WIP to try this year. I have no idea what's happening anymore, but I'm very entertained. What if everytime I would breathe, 1,500 words appear on the screen, That would be a pretty useful super power right now. This is huge for me. I think I have more in me.

Who thinks I am capable of bullshitting 9.5K of words today without any actual plot to work on? I find myself writing middle grade to young adult romance with a magical twist. 28k mark :) Reaching that next thousand pumps me up every time! :) So much to do this week, I'm glad i could put some words down on paper (real paper, lol). she just tried to matchmake my gay mc with her best male friend who is in love with her. I'd love to promote your book for free!

As soon as I procrastinate some more. My MCs demand I get every detail just right, the darlings. Aw man, I've never been so far below that line and still pulled it off before.

I should write, right? I love the name, this makes November much more bearable. I am both immensely proud and absurdly jealous. That was a nice little groove I got into. I need 875 more words to have 5k for the day...

My favorite line written before midnight : "I love you. in these moments it becomes clear to me why so many loved ones and innocent bystanders look constantly concerned during november. Positive feedback from my critique group? I've abandoned my New Adult novel to write children's historical fiction AND still won't admit I've got writer's ADD.

Almost done with my first story. Lol jk I still only have 300... 8000 words this weekend, still a bajillion words behind, but feeling good about what I've done. I have done 1013 words so I am allowed lunch right? A Noveltini and witty banter await me...

Writing, writing, writing til my eyes bleed, writing when it's easy, writing when it's hard. I'm rather stunned that I haven't exhausted myself yet. I just hope they're all in the right order. Regaining my comfortable groove. Okay, I'm officially awake.

I can catch up, right? I love it when a writing session, which started out rocky, turns into a success. 3490 words so far, and I'm not done yet. Be sure to send me an email if u'd like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K!

I can still write longhand with right. Be sure to send me an email if u'd like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K! I notice I can focus more when I have the tv on in the background, no sound. For some reason, I'm ready to wrap up the whole novel by 40k. Now to write 3 more and I'll be done with my goal for this month.

I named two completely separate characters the same thing. Okay, so long as I write 2,848 words every day from now on I will make my goal of 50K in 30 days! Including a super fun car chase in my novel, why?! I spoke to the muses and told them to be sure to keep you company.

I'm at 22k or so right now. Hope I can do a few more this evening. I would love to tell your story.

I've got a word count to hit, and the only thing that can help me is the Far Cry 3 : Blood Dragon soundtrack. I'm feeling a bit of Ray Bradbury sneaking in through my writing right now. I'm officialy in subplot hell realizing I still don't have a ending, or a lowest moment I'm satisfied with.

Apparently my two MCs. Am I right? I love it.

" Don't go putting your finger in all my plot holes right now darling. A better day for writing yesterday although I did take the evening off to spend with my daughter. Who ever thought I'd get a new scene idea from putting a new trash bag in the bin??? I've got chips, I've got salsa, I've got wayyy too much peppermint mocha... I get the most words when I write sex scenes.

Suffering from an interesting form of writer's block where my computer (where my story is) is literally blocked by Chriss. I had to move into the livingroom and light the fireplace. With everything else going on right now, I think I may admit defeat. I'd like to hear some interesting things that get other writers motivated. I really like writing novels when the research includes browsing for wedding rings with pink stone inserts.

I need more words. I'm happy with what is left in the plot. Right now is one of those times you probably wouldn't want to look at my search history. Yeah it's pretty clear, I'm just on page 2, but I can write it, write it...like I'm supposed to do... but then again it is 03:19(am) here, I don't know if that makes it better or worse than your situation.

My story took a major turn when my antagonist was supposed to defeat someone, but he was just too strong. Guess I should be happy I don't have to choose between two equally shitty lines. Going to melt these key with my fast fingers today! I think I can reach my goal if I play my cards right. With the life experience I've had, I would think I could describe being hungover better than this.

One is full of coffee to get me through the next few thousand words. I can't converse properly, my brain is full of knives and blood and spears and stuff. Why is it that my characters give such great advice, yet I can barely be bothered to put pants on of a morning? After missing a day for the best reason ever I'm already up to 20,444. " I'm too lovesick for love stories "

I love when I throw random crap into a story and think OH MY GOD I'M A GENIUS because it's suddenly perfect. Tony had to run to a cottage and met a new character that I didn't even know existed! Excuse me while I worshipfully kiss my own feet. totally lost track of time, I'm screwed on sleep now lol. Why do I need so many wards in my kingdom?

The only good part about it snowing outside is that it is also snowing in my story and my MC is contemplating it. " I better get moving. So there is a large surreal moon in my story. I want to write about a girl who's recruited as a Reaper, after Death saves her life, but falls in love with a ghost.

I certainly get practice at it! I'm currently at 3k, but I'm honestly happy with 5k today. I will have a girl run off to SF my heroes nearly run off the road on the way to Santa Cruz. Okay, I took a couple days off, but I shall get to 30K before I sleep tonight.

Almost reached 4k words written for today but, I must end on a good note of 3,896, leaving me at a total of 8,317 so far. I could write more but PALINDROME, PEOPLE. I keep on reminding myself that this is only the first draft. Bed was very tempting, but I managed to make quota. I'd love to promote your book for free!

Got my first half of 1,000 written. Few more minutes, then I'll get ready to leave. Though good news, I'm over the half way point if I wanted to go for 250K. I literally don't have time to read a book that I have to in my free time. I need more sleep.

November is my favorite month of the year. OK, I'm ready to write. " I "counts just as much as" sesquipedalian ". I might be getting a little too autobiographical as I make my char laugh at the servings per container label on a bag of chips.

Only a little behind and loving my story! Why is it more difficult to write at weekends when I have more time? So glad I'm working on a very short book right now. Despite a busy day, I still got a good word count. Like, I wanna know more about it, but I never get to see it.

:o) But tomorrow I have to go back to work... I like making my main character do chores. I'm so consumed by NaNoWriMo and editing that I think I spend more time following people than tweeting. So far so good and I'm ahead. I'd love to promote your book for free!

Welp, I've fallen back in love with my story. Maybe I'll be able to write today if I just whack my head against the wall repeatedly. One of them surprised me with her rage. How much tea have I had today?? Okay well I am at 36k.

aaaand my main character has been stabbed by an umbrella! I have an overwhelming desire to reread Falling Kingdoms right now. I might just post what I have so far on the internet. Just thought I'd hit my first 1,000 words for the day. I'd really just like to get to 25,000 for the month, though I'm happy with my progress.

Guess that means I've earned the right to log on for WoW tonight! I love getting ahead on the weekends. It's been harder to make time this week but I did make sure to write something each day. Can I just say that I love this season?

Then I decided to add another POV. Can I make a request that every time I open a new bottle of red, 1000 words magically get added up? Starting on 23280, so let's see how many words I can write today. I'm confident I can do it, but I think I'm running on adrenaline right now. I love everything about writing...

" I better get moving. But I was determined to stick with 3rd no matter how many times it got away... I'm at 46,111!

I complain too much! Best writing advice I've ever received : "The only person who can stop you from writing is you. At least I got to a pivotal meeting of characters. Embracing my new strategy when struggling : Write the ending first. Be sure to send me an email if u'd like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K!

I always take a week of November as holiday to make sure I keep on target. I now have a full tank of petrol in my car. Do I really want to go through that again? Yes I have caught up my word count, but I now ache everywhere.

I'm actually developing a plot now! Cause I'm young and I got story arc issues and my pacing's real slow...do I look like a mind reader sir? I'm determined to write my first 1000 words for today before I go to sleep. 500 more words and I will allow myself to go buy some new Magic cards. The most I've ever written for one piece.

Be sure to send me an email if u'd like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K! If I keep writing beats instead of beast, people are gonna think my werewolf is a dj during full moons. I haven't written much today. I can do this.

I want to do more today, but I need to think about what's next first. I'm so excited for this weekend. Yes, I'm running behind, but I've a chunk of free time tomorrow! I'm moving towards my next plot point as best I can.

Bit much for my series for what to call "kitten" anymore. 512 more words and I can go to sleep. Feel like I'm really making progress today. I've seen so many people use music to help them write.

Yup, going to the Night of Writing Dangerously is definitely one of my life goals. I'm all caught up for the first time in about a week. I found a better workflow in it and it helps me organize my ideas.

I'm in the Week 2 doldrums. instead I've got to focus on the first book, SIGH. I love symmetrical word counts.

I added 6,425 words today after writing nothing for 5 days straight! I love the feeling I get after reaching and surpassing my goal. 22,550 for my word count so far. I guess it's time for the main characters to fight some ninjas... I need 259 more today.




## Chapter 7 ##

I'm at 71k and i need to be at 90k by midnight tomorrow (or done with the book altogether.) So I know what to do with Luke. Wish me luck! Alright, today I'll be rebalancing some on my draft, so won't be moving forward, but fleshing out.

Just killing my darlings... hey I havn't had the time to tweet, I have been with my novel. I've got an amnesiac telepath being hunted by clockwork wolves. I'm ahead and I want to stay ahead and have ALL the words.

If I get to 4000 today, I'll meet Tuesday's goal already. I got 2,000 words written tonight! When I don't want to write, I make myself write anyway. HAVE I WATCHED VERONICA MARS. Ordered numbers are my downfall.

I like this character. " I HIT 25K! I reached par tonight and my word count goal. I am doing this.

" My imagination never gives me a choice. I'm going in. Oh my head. I'm still at 20k. I'm at 9,782 words now but I can type 2,000 wph.

Can I push through to 2,000 words tonight?! Maybe I'll introduce smurf unicorns. I have a lot of work to catch up on! " "Nothing, my dear Frodo.

I will not. But I will definitely hit it tomorrow. Since I don't write on Sundays I wanted to be at 40k today. 34,106 and I'm done for the night.

I crossed 40k. I hit 2,000 words for tonight (that's 24k total, if you're counting). I lied. I will make up for it over the weekend. After being too chemo to write yesterday, I'm back writing tonight.

I have been studying death whilst feeling like death for days. I just got over 3000 words for the day! I'm a maniac. Am I at the halfway point in my novel?

Listening to my daughter play clarinet and procrastinating. I want the boy gone. I'm three days ahead. I'm back on track! I'm FINALLY writing! After one hour of constant writing, I feel like my word count is actually going backwards.

You may think I'm avoiding writing my story. I've totally lost my marbles in the last five minutes or so.

Doesn't work and my baby know it's November??? Mopping up my feels now. Countdown to thanksgiving break means thinking about how to get my wordcount to 50,000. Never me, obvs. If only Tormund Giantsbane were here to help me climb over it.

597 words will get me to par. If I type nonstop? I finally did some outlining. Thank god I am ahead on my word count.

I like writing romance in middle grade, I'm finding. I wrote 10,012 words today at our midway party! Besides I got my 25k badge tonight! I think I'm pooped for the night.

Now I need to crawl out of my hole and go 2 my day job. I'd thought when I started if I just kept writing, sooner or later something would come to me. I'm so sleepy but I continue to write... Tomorrow I shall start anew!

Just hit 24,000 on my WIP. This is the story of me, Virginia Woolf! I made it thru the Night of Writing Dangerously last night with 5,958 added words! I think it still counts. 1230 words on my WIP today. Taking a day off (although not by choice) has affected my mojo... I've gota feeling...

Maybe I should do that sometime before the end of the month. How will I catch it? I Rock! I hope.

Was aiming for 1100 in 30 minutes as part of a challenge I'm following. I worked on my book today. Maybe I will finish on time.

Or as close to that as I can get, anyway. Why yes I am listening to the Nutcracker soundtrack as I write. " "Nothing, my dear Frodo. That's what I get for choosing to continue a started book. Did not hit 10k but my goal for today is 25,000 words.

No clue what I'm writing next. This day has only existed for an hour and forty minutes and I've written 2571 words. When you don't physically have shoulders cuz you're a ball of slime : "You can cry on my, er, lack of shoulder. I CAN do it! I am SOOO close to 50k.

Inner editor and inner critic : I do believe you were both placed on leave without pay until the end of the month. I wish my tweets counted toward my word count. Just typed out a brief outline of my novel day16 into the process. Stretch goals, I have them. I'm at 24004 words and I'm grateful. I have to stop and make a character list, it feels rather apropos.

" "Nothing, my dear Frodo. I MUST! Can I get a WHOOP! Awake earlier than I need to be today.

I almost got sucked into Pinterest. I just lost 3000 words. Don't know if this counts for anything, but my story is now 60 pages!!

FINALLY surpassed my work target for the day! ewww my characters are kissing.. I SURRENDER. I regret everything. This time though, I'm writing it.

Do you think I can do? I wrote 4K today. Going back to the editing I was doing.

I've got Thanksgiving to host, so I gotta git' er done. Is this my novel's way of telling me I need a life? I have no motivation to write at all. I keep thinking I should have written another HF novel this year rather than adventure. Tomorrow will consist of my bed and MacBook.

If you want to add me on the site, my name is Veranza. REPEAT : I HAVE PASSED THE HALFWAY POINT. I WILL WRITE ALL NIGHT IF I HAVE TO DARN IT!!! Who will be my 500th follower? I'm not ashamed of my low sprint count!

Clarity : that last tweet was from my novel. I wrote an entire scene longhand. Today I passed the word count I ended with for last year's NaNo. I can do it...

1700 words at lunchtime brings me to par for today. I have rediscovered my dream. Stared outlining from the middle on this piece, realized I was way out of sync. Tomorrow my goal is to break 21,000! I am DOING it!

I thought it was backed up! I have somehow coughed my way into a plot twist. Because I'm writing, and I just made myself cry. Well it's finally happened, as I knew it would. Would I be pushing it if I hoped to reach 15,000 by tonight?

AND I SHALL. I think you've just invented a "thing. Which is why I'm trolling twitter now. Still feeling like I can catch up.

3000 words, here I come. Who's with me? Twitter is still a bit of a mystery to me. there is going to be a dog in my book?

Then I have a buffer if I start lagging during the week. Literally every time someone walks into my room while I'm writing, I lost my train of thought. And it took all day but I made it. I have needs too! This brings me up to 25,552 for the month of November. I have sparkling water to chase away the sleepy eyes.

Report those words, my lovelies!!! I slacked. I seem to have lost some words from word overnight. listening to "I Know Places" by Tswift while my characters are running from robots.

I want to see 30k today at minimum! I'm getting Internal Server Error messages when I try tweeting. I am going to study for a while as I contemplate the next steps. The emotion returned, and guided me. You never glare at me anymore.

I turns out I've written over 2K today. I'm going to need a beta reader like it's going out of style. No worries, I'll catch up Tuesday. I'll probably have close to a novel by the end... I've never gotten emotional over a character before.

Had to meet my word quota for today and I did. Day 13 is over, and I just passed 25000 words!!!!! Who's with me?? I've lost my writing momentum.

But I'm not even close to finished yet!! I will now finish on February 14th! 2,317 words of the 3,000 I had wanted today. That is the question I ask myself as I bullshit another thousand words.

I bet I'm almost done for the day. School has me slacking... I supposed I could start tomorrow's count after midnight, but I need to rest. I felt elated and then remembered tomorrow is Monday and I have a day job. I'm on a roll!

To avoid getting sicker, I just guzzled the last of my Hydrocodone. I need to. Someone talk some sense into me, please? But I almost used it today. Can't wait to get out of work so I can go home, and write.

At 30k, it's been 11 days in my novel. Repented for my sin of not writing anything for the last 3 days. Officially hit 50 pages in my manuscript today. ...but it's the same place every time, my bed!

OMG writing this tiny, jewish mambo from queens is killing me! My head hurts and I only got out 500 words today. Question : why isn't my novel writing itself? I told a friend it took two hours to write 1k words.

I can do this. (see what I did there?) Wish me luck! It's writing time and I don't feel like it one bit.

I ended up with 489. (Or so I keep telling myself.) WAAAAAAH I MISS YOU ALREADY. BTW, I'm at 21,285 words.

I literally have a Token White Male. I have to start writing again tomorrow. Looks like I'll finish before vacation starts! Today I reached 17K!

I'm psyched. Every time I almost catch up, the clock rolls over. Guns and fcking Roses is currently blasting on my theater. I am starting to have a legitimate fear that I will not finish in time this year.

I am halfway to the goal I set for today! I WON!! Gonna write my 2000 and catch up this weekend. I think we might give me...

I DON'T KNOW. I can write 2k words an hour. ...Yeah, I would've preferred to be writing. Today is my push day.

3,000 words into my goal of 6,000 for the day. My eyes may fall out of my head in my sleep. In last night's dream I turned Neverland into Candyland by eating antimatter. Thank you to whoever bought the physical copy of my book on Amazon.

20882 total for me. I'm going to play with some plotbunnies instead. I might just have to go for it and finish 50,000 by tomorrow. Just saw my Word document hit 20,000! I thought I got enough sleep...

Go me. I'm at just over 19k. I'm hardcore slacking. What do I do when I hit a wall in a story?

I hope so. And that's what I do. I don't know how I did it.. Who thinks I can catch up tonight?

I've just counted what I wrote during a day. Hopeful I can get over 10K done but Im running out of scenes to write! I might tear off a big chunk this weekend. All my Wonder Woman comics...gone.

I may shed a tear. I'm going to need chocolate. That's why I use them. I needed a break.

Though I admit, I'm in need of a shower, which I hope to do when I get up tomorrow, before I write on my project! I can't even spell anymore. I CAN DO EEEET!!! I might write something today.

The 1K words I wrote yesterday, might be the biggest breakthrough I've had in over a year. But I shall not despair! I gotta be like Alanna in Corus and Mulan in her "Be a Man" montage and PERSEVERE! getting me psyched to write.

Think I'm going to rest now. Just wrote five paragraphs that I realized are definitely just for my benefit not the readers'. I'll be answering questions on here from 6. Who's with me?

I can't even deal, guys. Music is distracting me tonight. Oh my god. Ending my procrastination. Wish me luck!




## Chapter 8 ##

I wrote 10,000 words over the weekend. I broke 25K! I just wrote about Yelp in my WIP. Put an Easter egg of Dumbledore's office into my description of the Wizard's laboratory. My backup machine ate my last chapter.

I wrote 1686 train words!!! I'm scared! I know where it's going, but the path changes. Yes, tomorrow I will be! I need a name for a disgraced, drunken lieutenant.

I will write another time... I just needed to talk the story out a bit. Rereading bits of my story for inspiration. I need Freddie Roach to coach me through it.

Another 1151 and I will be all caught up for the day!! I've written myself into a corner again. Going to get some writing in as I wait for stuff. lawd please let me be productive tonight.

she's so big that she crashed my work computer... Had another 5k day and my word count just cleared 60,000! For the next 15 days, I'll only work on book 4, which I've been neglecting in favor of book 3.

Ended up with my total word count at 32323. Can I count going to a writing workshop as my word count for the day? I'm have no discipline.

Did I? I might actually make it with this novel! How the hell did I manage 2,400 words across 10 A5 pages? Wohoo I'm at 50k, I should be at 57k by the end of this day. Work, school, packing and trying to write is literally draining me... I'm halfway there!

Day 12 : Beginning to suspect outline doesn't possess 50k words of material, I'll have to start describing stuff. I've written 5,131 words tonight. Rounded out my day 12 total with 42k. I might just go get me an ice cream cake! I just hit over 25K!!!!!

I am DOING it! But after writing 11k in 2 days I'm starting to catch up so maybe I can do it? Been nesting at my desk. I'm rocking this.

San Francisco, I am in you! Going to make this an all day writing event for me. Halfway to my goal. I'm a novelist. I need some cheerleaders!

if I can.) I'm ahead! Now as soon as I write 1,000 words, I can get some. All but two of my characters disappeared last week and haven't been seen or heard!

I go drink some alcohol now. I am at 40K words! 8,000 a day isn't unattainable if I just do nothing but write. I say "the end". That's gonna set my progress back. I can't see anything.

My 5 y.o. daughter told me : "Mom, I'm going to be a writer like you when I grow up. This year I will finish. I made it! I just broke through the 6000 word barrier! Ugh I need to ice my wrists.

Wish me luck. I don't know why, but I have an urge to play video games today... This 100 000 words in a month idea is killing me. And with that, I'm going to bed. last night I hit my halfway mark!

I just opened my blinds so I could look at the snow, which means I'll definitely not be getting anymore writing done today. Hey guys guess what I REACHED 50K TODAY. Wrote 532wds on the bus on my way to work today! I have made it to 25,000 words. I predict severe overcaffeination today.

I think a 100:1 ratio of potential to putrid prose. I don't know. I guess that's a sign I should be writing instead. I might just reach that today! I'm a writer, just keep on writing!

Yet what I am doing? I am. Hopefully I can finish by this weekend! Yelling at my characters when they start derailing the story. Dun dun duuuunnnnnnn I currently have 38,600 words!

So bummed I lost a bunch of work. You don't understand it, how can I explain? I have done this. Which means I just need to write about twenty thousand words today to catch up.

I am DOING it! I actually won a second basket, but they said one basket per person. I need to reharness that quippiness. 8,000 words into my 10,000 word sprint for the day. There we go, it's midnight and I just made word count for the day! I'm at 2k now and headed for 5k today!

" I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! I broke 10K! Wish me luck. 16,000 words on my project. Oh alright who am I kidding?

I'm TRYING. I needed it. Afterwards, I may tackle 40k. Taking a break then trying to get 6958 I need to finish. I'm in the home stretch!

I don't know. 25,000 words for me, and there are still three hours left to write at the Evening of Scribing Recklessly! I passed 25k words! " I've always told Summer everything, but this is the one thing she can never know. 7pm brings me to 1225. In my Hawaiian shirt Writing my novel.

I just hit 15,000 a bit ago... Need to get my butt in gear to reach 25,000 tomorrow!!! If I can manage just over 5k words today I will finally be caught up on my word count. What should I be doing?

But I can do this!! I regret nothing. I'm thinking dialogue for pace. I hit 34,000 words and realized it's getting close to the time when things should blow to holy hell!

I've stopped. I found the darkness and my inspiration again. Yes, I know I should be over 26,000 by today. Number of words I just wrote too. I've just been attacked by a rogue story idea!

So no sleep tonight so I can stay ahead. I don't care, I'm taking a shower. I think if someone had explained to me that writing is a lot like playing god, well, I would have started this years ago. now i want to put snow in my story even though it's the end of summer.

Bit worried I'll run out of plot before I finish 50k. I'm not leaving the house anyways. Can I go to bed now? I'll be sprinting tomorrow if you're around. Take my hand and we'll make it I swear...

Need to play catch up today in order to make it to my goal. I need storylines. I saved these from Adam. I am doing both way and allow my mind pour out. I write 0 words yesterday.

I only wrote 744 words today but that was enough to pass the halfway point! I did it. Oh, and PS : I hit 20K. Today is my day for getting back on track!

Perfectionism is my fiercest inner demon. I have gundam inspiration to thank for this. Now I want cake. As I write this I'm constantly thinking does this character have a strength or dexterity check for this?

I did it I reached 50k! It's SCREAMING at me to write it! I can't talk to him anymore because he knows who I am. Should I kill myself? But I am only 1,850 words away from 40k.

I wanted to hit 40k today, but decided to socialize. Writing about it makes me miss being there! Maybe I should get a puppy. Monday I shall conquer! I am so behiiiiiind.

Now if my mutinous Trigeminal nerve will let me. I can do this! I swear I'm not ignoring Twitter, I'm just writing, working, or sleeping. Well, not quite on target, but I finally broke 25,000! I'm done.

The career author beat me. 15 minutes left and I've only written about 700 words!! One of my characters is changing and I don't like it. I'm failing today.

I'm waiting for an email so you know what that means? That's my word count. I hope so. I have 3800 to go to reach 30k today... Yes, yes I would.)

I DID IT! I'm starting a 30 minute word sprint on Write or Die now. Oh I forgot to tweet! I am DOING it!

My story has been on my mind all afternoon! Broke for pizza, put kiddo to bed, and now I've lost all momentum. Making it to 40k is my goal for tonight. " the giant announced, handing me a broomstick.

" Winging it "didn't work for me. Come join me! I based some characters on them. I'm looking forward to rewriting!

If I can get back on par with word count I'll post something that shows how I used to connect myself with writing. I am DOING it! I need coffee. Conundrum : I have tonight to myself.

Now I can cook the kids tea and write! Managed to hit my 2k word goal for the day, but it was a grind. In my defense, I've had a lot of life to contend with.

Open question to my follow writers : What would a date with a imaginary friend be like. Noveling makes me hungry. But I'm writing. I dont even like dogs.

I am DOING it! Well, I am FINALLY caught up. I'm not bragging I swear! Day 15 final count since I hit a wall. I need to log some words!

I think I'll call it a night. I have a feeling a lot of this backstory will be edited out...next month, when I do a rewrite. Think I can do it? I am not going to get this thing written by the end of the month. Dumped my MC in the oubliette, now I have to figure out how to get him out.

Eight chapters into my epic fantasy spoof HORDE, and the party is thinking about starting the quest. Someone force me to be productive. How would I feel if the events were happening to me? I can't remember the last time I started writing before 10pm...

Jimmy Fallon is trying to get my attention. As if I was going through the motions. I hope. Over 2000 words written today and I'm still going! Only wrote 800 words today, and it's all history, not story, but I think I've rerailed the train before it could crash.

Now as soon as I write 1,000 words, I can get some. I just might make it halfway today. I will double my word count by Monday... I need to find a way to recapture that inspiration and motivation I had. I have 8000 words to write just to get back on track.

I'm going to have to do some big word days! ...that I am here for him if he ever just can't take the silence anymore... I wrote 7,000 words today. I'm about at my total for 2013 already. I want to hit 25k today!

" Otherwise, my head will explode. They will see themselves as pirates but I've got their mannerisms nailed. I want time to read a book. Which means I'll have to pull two 5k days in the next week.

Please, story, don't run out of words before I get there! I rastled almost 2k words out of my brain today, bringing my total to 19019. I think so. 6500 words today and I just hit 30,000.

I hit a wall at 22,000 words. I don't think I'm going to hit 50,000 words for National Novel Writing Month but I did just pass 15,000. I have finally crossed the 35,000 word threshold. Away from me, ye stouthearted, that are on...

I'm stoked where my stories are taking me. Here's a sample of my outline. Anybody want to tell me what burnt skin smells like? But now that I've been fed and watered, I feel motivated to write! Why yes, I did just hit that mark.

Except maybe not because I just realized I've only written 200 words since my last word count. I caught up on a lot of paperwork at work. I'm now up to 14,611 words. I shall redouble my efforts!

I have a sore wrist from overuse. I wrote a throwaway line that resulted in a 4,000 word plane hijack sequence. 300 words to go until I hit my next target! I'm using this for my writing portfolio to get into a PHD program. I'm not doing anything but writing today!

I'm outta here! Must take a break from sprints to put something in my belly. I can't reach my word count! I have a feeling a lot of this backstory will be edited out...next month, when I do a rewrite.




## Chapter 9 ##

I may have spent my day finishing the Lego Batman game. I mean her word count is so big Look! I'm looking forward to the second half of the month. Now I am too. I can do this...

Lucas keeps doing it and I'm not sure where he learned it. I have a few extra scenes and a minor subplot I can do for padding, so hopefully that helps. I am stuck in the doldrums.

I didn't count the time' cause I was doing other stuff too, like eating breakfast. Wordcount goes up steadily, but I'm always stuck 7k behind no matter how hard I write! I only plotted one chapter of Book 3.

Edit my personal essay or write the opening scene of this story that's been percolating? Too lazy to transfer it to my computer tonight.

Even if I don't finish by November 30, it's at least inspired me to start something new. But I don't want to do the writing part. I mean, seriously, I did 4K words today which is fantastic for me. I'm at that stage in my novel where I think the whole thing is a bad idea. Even if I don't finish by November 30, it's at least inspired me to start something new. I made it halfway!

Even if I don't finish by November 30, it's at least inspired me to start something new. But I want to. I am currently at a little over 15k. Feeling a lot better about this novel I hate. But I might make it anyway.

Not much more before I'll be back on schedule. I fear I may be procrastinating... Headache isn't as bad, so I'm hoping for an extra epic writing day. That was me jumping up and down as I figured out my next plot twist. I can't believe it.

I have paper and pen. No infomercials puts a wrinkle in my plan. And that's another 1,395 words down, if I counted correctly, fora total of 2,407 words written today. That isn't exactly where I wanted to be at this point in the 30 Day Challenge, but hopefully I'll have some writing spurts! I'm also vaguely disturbed by the fact that I seem to be killing off all my male characters.

Now to bullshit my way through a million and one appendices. I've crossed the 19k mark!!!! I suppose it's not really in the spirit of the challenge to type the same curse word 50,000 times? My bottle of imagination is a quarter down the bottom, and my jar of motivation, is dry. Last year was such a fail I don't know what happened. I'm not really sure why.

Just finished editing my word count : from 26019 to just 2816... You are not going to make me cry in Starbucks! I'm a couple of days behind and could really use some motivation at the moment! Should get it finished this week and then I can return to my other wip! It won't let me be lazy.

But I'm sorry it's not actually pig intestines. but it's also the first time I haven't given up once behind. I shall not give up!

Dragged 2222 words out from the dark recesses of my subconscious and nailed them into word. Opened my eyes an hour later...I guess I'll need to type a little faster... I've been given a word count target of 2500 this evening.

but then I didn't write a single word yesterday... Do I make 25k tonight? So I need to write like 4000 words today to catch up with the average! I HATE not being able to remember a word when I'm trying to write. Time to roll up my sleeves and dive back in.

I'm not pleased. and when I say double figures, I mean 10000, not like 12. No I don't live in Twin Peaks. cleaning my apartment. I'm running out of synonyms for deformed...

" I've only read 4 books this month, "cries the girl who usually reads a book a day. You, me, computer, Bria Lana and all those gods crowding in her head. I'm in the home stretch, but I'm not sure there are 10,000 words left in this project. I think the flu has hit our house.

I think i going to step away for a hotel. I must be doing a good job because I'm making myself sick. only about 500 words today, which is not enough but at least it gets me past 24k. Like Arya Stark, I say "Not today!

" I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! The ones on my head, not my face. Well, I didn't cry, but that scene left me feeling a little empty and I'm not sure I'm ready to continue... I mean they are fictional, after all. Ack, using Word instead of my usual Scrivener.

I will not fall behind after such a promising start. I need 6000 words to catch up to tomorrow's pace. My background is in news so my fear of missing a deadline is pushing me on. I had to stop twice to relieve a...cramp.

Rainy day, but I guess it wouldn't matter. My writers tried to warn me but those words you got make me so wordy! I have done the impossible and that makes me mighty. I've been lazy today.

Today I wrote 2620 words and have a total of 24,785. Tonight, I get caught up. As my antagonist's arc gets more and more convoluted and cruel, I want to write his prospective less and less. I am going no where, I will be by your side until we both go down fighting. I'm past 45K but not finished with the story.

And now I'm crying (metaphorically) because I'm not even at half of what I should have at this point. I'm off to write it! A small victory but only the beginning of my writing journey today! I wrote 1300 words on my phone.

I swam for the swim team in high school (poorly). Say, I passed the 20k word mark today in the WIP! I named my Victorian Era brothel "The Dirty Cleaver" much to my boyfriend's horror. I know I'm still far FAR behind. I wrote 1,479 words AND I hit 40k overall in the process!

I will cross 25k today. 3132 words for today, pushed me to 21625 words total. One of my characters just decided to come out (both to me and the other characters). RS : Although next year, I'm going to prepare a random jar of motivational snippets to keep me going.

I think it's doable. Before you chain me to the computer like a slave again... I know I'm still far FAR behind. I do mean things to fictional people. I am definitely in the wrong line of work.

Can I get a WHOOP! I know I'm not going to make 1667 today. Am I crazy for genuinely considering starting over? I've lost my mojo when my character went down a hill. Now I can put it away for a while and wait for the big game!

I'm not sure I'll fully catch up, but I'm going to keep going. Can I make up for it with 15k in less than 10 hours? The character that I spent a lot of time building up just died, and her fiance is about to find out. After four days of epic writers block, I managed to get 6,468 words down tonight. Immediately regretted those initial caps because my iPhone keyboard hates me. Finally, I got to write about something exploding!

Think I've just finished one of the most disgusting scenes I've ever written. I might not blog any more this month :(GARGH. Typed it all up and my word count is 14,673 as of now. 1,115 words for me.

So far totalling 6380 words today, and bringing me past the halfway mark at 26 801 words! I am DOING it! I hate when I try to butt in to my own story and my characters reject the idea. You get me to write!

My current wordcount is 22222 and this is extremely pleasing to me. After a lax weekend I need to write 4,000 today. I'm only about 3K behind now. Can someone pleas ehelp me somehow?

I can't feel my hand anymore... Help me figure out what... I've been sitting at my desk for too long! I'm down. I'm the definition of an amateur.

200 words in and I'm not sure my characters are going to like this chapter. I'm having serious writer's block and have only written a paragraph. I feel you slipping away. Incentive to keep going, or an excuse to put my feet up and open a beer? This happens once before I write a chapter. I wanna see tons of wordies.

Now I'm only 10k behind! Gah, I'm about 5k behind right now... Give me your words, then break for 10.

I need to find a way to put it in my story. I might just have to go for it and finish 50,000 by tomorrow. It's going to be long and hard (for my characters, mainly). I'll have to hunt down some of these bands. I wanted a 5k Saturday, but I'm not sure if that's going t'happen.

I always seem to fail on the second week. Today I will not let myself down. Threw down 1,999 words in the last hour, bringing me to 2,504 total. Can I stop time for a day so I could catch up on my word count? This last serial will be finished when I reach 40,000 words.

Now I'm only 5,000 words behind! Cousin is asleep, finally sitting down to write my last 2000 words for today. Still have the afternoon ahead of me.

Not sure how I feel about this... I think it's time to wind down. However much of this I realize will be cut, it's forced me to start writing prose. I tried. I just can't.

I hate when I write a really good line and then nothing... I' ll. And Now I must go to bed because the last 1000 all but refused to get onto the page and I'm exhausted. I can't force any words to come out...

There are no goats in my novel. I'm not writing at all this weekend so next week is gonna suck, but I CAN DO THIS. Not sure if nothing's actually happened in this novel yet or if it feels that way cuz I know there are THINGS to come. Now I'm finally past 10k.

which I usually do. 1778 in on the manuscript, 0 in on the 2 papers I have due tomorrow night. This is one of those crappy days when I want to quit. My MC just looked and me and said, "Now what do you want me to do?

Unfortunately, I have NO idea what happens next. I feel like he's staring everyone down. The writing I've engaged in over recent months, specifically the novel, have been hollow. It was driving me nuts. I did end up writing 1024 words bringing me to a total word count of 20045, so I'm still on tract.

Not really worried about my overall word count. Does my novel even have a plot anymore? I'm getting tired, but still 2k short of where I want to be tonight. I should go to bed, but why ruin the mojo?

Just blew past my halfway point, and the momentum grows. I feel like jumping up and down. I should have started using Write or Die a long long time ago. If I focus for a couple of hours, I can do it. " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days!

I'm about a whole section behind when it comes to posting these excerpts. I'll try to get chapter 8 done tomorrow. Spent a lot of time looking up information about electric violins for my story. Well, I've written over 10K today...

Got 600 words done before my laptop decided to do an arbitrary update and restart. Couldn't have done that if I'd tried. Today I have really struggled to focus on writing, I think it's cause I haven't written in two days, but it is frustrating. I JUST HIT 35k WORDS!

I had my bag stolen at the Santa Claus parade : laptop, tablet, headphones, wallet, everything. I sat down to write a battle scene and I have 500 words describing the armies. K so, I wrote a story that was almost 19000 words long. I might be hitting my tipping point though. I've just finished the sentence started yesterday.

Hit a narrative wall where I'm not entirely sure the rest of the story is going. I've written 750 words, so it's not a complete loss. Write and write my Wordlings.

I'm beginning to use "My hair needs to be done" as an excuse to not write. I'll keep following, but my sides are hurtin. I'm a little stuck now. I'm running out of words for the dark. I wrote 5006 words today.

Not sure what that says about me. Sometimes there's just other things to do before getting my word count in. In case anyone was wondering : Sir Bedivere is my dude. Maybe I should get a puppy.

The words are flowing, but I'm not sure this idea can reach 50k words in the end. I need a break to plot my next few scenes! 26,010 and I'm done for the night! I made boozy Butterbeer.

I like parts of it, but I don't love it. I'm putting down what I have stagnated on to start on something else. I guess inspiration goes a long way. I've written about 3000 words today which is wayyyy below what I need to catch up. I also cleaned the toilets.

I should be writing but I'm in sugar coma. I am not a total failure, damnit! I so wish I had written last night, but I'm finally back on track with my word count.

I am DOING it! Last chapter tonight, then I must sleep. I can't exactly stop NOW, can I? I've got airships, motorbikes, gliders, alien (?)

I KEEP SLIPPING INTO 1ST PERSON WHEN I SHOULD BE WRITING IN 3RD!!! Just gotta write, I'll b goin to 1159am 2 make it. I'm knee deep in my novel but still behind. And I'm not even done with my story!

Wish me luck. I am DOING it. Okay, weekend of the Night of Writing Dangerously, here I come! Not sure what I should call it.

Sorry I have to stop my 15 minute word sprints to eat a candy cane it's important. I am DOING it! In a tank top and all I have is a dirty cardigan from my trunk. THIS IS THE PART WHERE I GET REALLY ANXIOUS GUYS. It's going to take more than cold fingers to stop me. Before I write another word Javert!

I'm an outliner myself, but always curious about how others do it. It feels like I've won already. Nothing else to do but try, I suppose. Pantsing as I go, and I'm at a critical point, but it's still slow going. One of my characters is acting very out of character, so I decided that she's drunk right now. 1731 words and I'm gonna come up for some air.

This cold is trying to keep me from adding more words. nothing is going to stop me from hitting 40k words tonight. I'm at a little over 27k. Except I'm not entirely sure what happens in the second half. I just hit a 20,000 word milestone, yay!




## Chapter 10 ##

Starting to have a little faith that I'm going to get those 50,000 written. I will not let the virus get the upper hand until I got there. Today should be the day, though, when I hit 50K! I believe it does! Don't they understand I have a word count to attain.

Hard to believe I've trudged this far. 2500 words today makes my current WC 21661. Why do I dread writing tomorrow? So I know what to do with Luke. Broke 19K last night, and writing is getting easier though my schedule is not.

I need to get writing. Last night, thanks to a fake Ebola scare, I had to work 15 hours.

My fingers are waiting, but my brain is not transmitting... I would be tempted to do it again but I remember how I regretted it come Saturday... I think that's enough... I've typed till my hand hurts. I'm really starting to feel like I'm going to fail this whole thing.

I have been working on my novel for the last six hours and I literally cannot stop. I hit 15k words today! Still about 3500 words behind but if I can hit 19K tonight I will feel a little better. I'll just have to keep going, then! Hear me roar.

If you are signed up for my newsletter, check your inbox. I don't know why I'm tweeting all this. And also my wrist still no better really. I just wrote my way from Cyprus to Halicarnassus. 2,160 words today, which I think is my biggest daily count this month.

I don't even like cake. And I got them out of the hospital! Now I must sleep. I'm confusing myself so there's no hope for any potential future readers. I guess I'll get some morning words in. I should be close to the middle of my story.

It's getting harder for me. but I'm so close to being all caught up. I am FLYING through this novel! This is my last sprint with you guys, so let's make all the words count! She is quite the conflicted slave, I must say.

Sis1 is begging me to watch a movie with her? On migraine day 3 and I smell like an apothecary. I wrote 1300 words on my phone. Tomorrow I can work on my outline.

I beat it up and left it for dead in a ditch. And yes I'm supposed to be writing instead... I've hit the halfway mark! I just reached 25,803 words. I'm doing a marathon weekend to make up some ground.

but I will work harder then I bet have. It's morning, and I'm still freaking out about these characters who are kissing without authorization. So I'm going to settle for anything. RS : And I'll post them here so you can all see.

" This is an experiment to see how well Dragon NaturallySpeaking can take my Dick Tatian. Two weeks in and I finally find my voice for the story. can I do it?? I am wondering about the narrator.

## Chapter 12 ##

I have earned one sticker today. And my college assignments, but eh. I onbuttoned the vidscreen and browserpopped to twitter. Mentioned I skipped 2 hanky panky scenes to write later.

I'm worried that my excitement for writing has tied itself to the Spurs season. I wanna write with ya! I intend to reach 30,000 words this evening. I need alcohol. I wrote over 6k today...

4 minutes to midnight and I hit the 1,700 word count for today! I write. If someone said I'd still be doing this 2 weeks in, I'd ask "why would you say something like that? Missed my writing goal yesterday by 600 words.

What about my wordcount? I think my heroes might be walking into a trap... I WILL make 50,000 by Sept 30. The thing I like about daily writing is the intensity of your story consuming your thoughts. I am entitled to watch television now.

But I am now working on finishing this novel. my simplified character and conflict formula : what does he want? Well, I didn't hit 2k words tonight but that's alright. 1,800 words tonight and I'm calling it quits. Let's add on to my word count at 20 after 4 in the morning. I'm not participating but am cheering for those who are!

I'm beat. Why must I have such a competitive nature? I gotta a gaming itch.

Now I'm googling if the strip club, Jilly' s, was opened in Toronto in the 1960s. I just made a really big decision about my storyline. My male MC just told my female MC that his grandmother is Lady Luck. So I hit 48.2k words today. 3100 words until I hit my goal. Hit my 10K for the day!

only hit 1,322, but I'm still on track. Got some outlining for my next chapter done. I'm on a roll! None of my writing buddies are getting together tonight...

I'm gonna. I'm not even participating this year! Halfway through the month, and I can't believe I'm still on pace! I gave it an entire night to try. I can't sit idly and watch that person perish.

I only wrote 1,087. Need to hurry my ass up... Wish me luck. It thinks I'm listening.

I've never written so much in such a short amount of time in my life. I literally vant mm not tuopst. Determined to get 2,000 words before I have to go out tonight. Now I'm just sleepy af. Now I need sleep.

Think I'll make that my target and then get some rest. And my brain is so frazzled, I almost didn't make that connection. I can almost see the climax from here! I want to take either my ChunHo fic or my JaeHo fic and use it. just over 1500 words until I reach 50k.

So I passed 50k about seven hours ago. I'm writing. 1,841 words written today, giving me a total of 23,231. I have no idea where it's going. I think that's a record for me.

I recommend. can the rest of my life stop now so i can finish this...? That means I did 1716 words today! Just passed 37k and I'm steadily getting plugged back into my novel after a few days without writing.

It's 10 pm and I need to go to bed in 30 minutes due to an early morning. I literally have a gun to his head and I'm having second thoughts. Think that I have what it takes? I think I've earned a day off, don't you? I already can't wait to edit it.

I've already won over 5K words, plus I'm honing my writing discipline. Letting the doubt roll off me, letting the questions and hesitations pass. I've topped 30,000 words now and I'm like, How am I going to end this with just 20k words left? I regret this scene. Took me long enough, even with only one hand.

I'm so far behind on my word count, it's not even funny. I am DOING it! Now to attempt to write another 2k before I sleep off this headache! " I prefer the term "power nuggets. I am stuck at 20k. And I wouldn't mind a three book contract too.

I've been very busy last few days, but now I am back! I feel like bursting into song... I won't give up!

Cut me. but I sort of want to. Night writing here I come!

I have to get 50k by then... I type it out and say... I just don't know how to write it. Got a lot going on today, but still managed to bump my word count to 10,563.

I hit over my 2k words goal for the night. " I equate writing it with "vomiting. I needed a night away from writing over 2k. I won't let the 2nd week slog prevail!

...and then I needed to remember the name of the gang in the coastal town nobody's visited in the book yet. I got this! Wish me luck! I wasn't feeling well the last few days so I took some time off from writing to sleep (like a jerk) but I'm back in action.

I somehow managed to reach my word count for today after getting no sleep last night and running around all day. I THINK I figured the ending out. Do I have energy to write words to night. HOW DO I GO ON? Now it's time for sleep before my brain turns to jelly.

Maybe I'll try this approach again tomorrow! I have been writing like the WIND today. NaNoNaNoNaNoNaNo is just running through my head to the tune of 60's Batman. Not bad, but I'm still quite behind.

not my usual writing, but a pretty good base going on. I can't be stopped. I'm outlining a short dystopian! I wonder what will happen if I get both the 5,000 word badge and the 10,000 word badge in the same day...

Feeling the "will I finish on time" dread. I resolved to actual pen and paper since the computer was too distracting tonight. Weird how most of my chapters are roughly 1,700 words...

Contact me. I have finally figured out the conflict of my novel! Goal of the day is to break 10k for my total word count. I just wrote 697 words today. Just got the idea for a revision "to do" spreadsheet for things I know I want to revise after November.

Let myself get intimidated looking at the single page of research I did last month. I set the house on fire and broke the MC's ankle. As I leave my character asking a phone sex operator for therapy, my word count is : 14,603. I HIT 25K WORDS!!!

I'm SO hungry! She sounds like my daughter. I think I'm done. I'm thanking god I skipped this year! Was wondering how long it'd take for me to fall into a hole and not know how to write myself out.

I have a goal for the end of this book, you are not included ma'am. I don't fee like writing today. Writing in the morning brings out my productive side. I managed to catch up!

Day long class again today, but if I write before, and during lunch, and tonight, I think I can break 25K. I JUST HIT 25K!!!!!!!!! Grad school has been kicking my butt this Nov! I will double my word count by Monday. Yes, I did just feed my child Pop Tarts and a pudding cup for dinner.

Shake them fingers and toss me those counts. AND I broke the 23k mark! Maybe I should do that sometime before the end of the month. tbh I can't get myself to write. What does that say about me?

Debating if I should reach for 100k tonight. Passed 20K in my manuscript! I'll watch one episode then get back to writing! This has been a strange week but I am still up to 35800 words. I managed to get my word count up to date 5mins before midnight. My eyes are getting fuzzy, so I'm going to call it a night...

Don't think you've cracked me because you haven't! Hit my 100k then kept on writing. Therefore I will be staying in my Marvel pj's and having a stream of hammer horror films in the background. Even if I'm trying to save the ghost of a ghost.

Not quite the 8k I hoped for, but I can see the ending now. I have nightmares that cliches are coming to get me. Think I can make it to 40K before I go to bed Sunday night? Less than 300 words away from my target today.

And will continue on with my Sunday. I'm behind right now, but not for long. I think that's a record for me.

DM me. I'm shooting for 3K today. Some time over the last few days my novel has replaced my thesis as the longest work I've ever written. " I prefer the term "power nuggets. I'm getting a lot of' feels'.

That's less than I wrote on Day 1. I even took a snooze. Omg. I cannot write in this weather. I typed "the yare" instead of "they are" and discovered that "yare" is actually a word! I think I can.

As for my half of this twitter's Novel... I'm in the hole 6,000 words, which isn't daunting at all. which reminds me don't forget to stretch between sprints!!

The coffee I had an hour and a half ago is not sticking with me. Haven't hit 25k yet but on my way. I see the end in sight! Thought I hit a wall. I passed the 20,000 word mark.

Looking like I will take the rest of the week to catch up. Yes, yes I know I'm still above the target I want MOOOAARR! Princess heads out to avoid my stalker, there wasn't really a tonight thing. " I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs... I just wrote something that would mean I wouldn't allow this novel to see the light of day.

I'm turning off the internet. 40k now, can I make 50k in 1 sitting? Also I really don't want to write anything. I need another thousand words in the next two hours. I hate it so much when main characters get just dreadful,which is why I feel like I actually love my main character tbh.

I'm at 17,666 words when I should be at 23,333. Being a lazy ass writer right now and not working on my words. I'll meet yall on the other side of insanity where the buckets of ice cream are. I write about 10k monthly, so. I'm way behind but glad I took the time I needed.

I hit fifty thousand words in just half a month. Not what I expected on several fronts, but I'm going with the flow here. Yes, I'm hearing that the Fortress of 25k has crumbled! Why am I here?? Not that this means anything as my personal target is wildly different. Works for me! Well, kind of, since I'm still behind!

Hit my personal NaNo goal! My chapter went places I totally didn't expect tonight. Now I want to play Half Life 2 again. I don't even want to see how many words I am behind, but I just know it's a lot.

Think I can do it? 23,005 words and I am starting to believe that I can actually do this. I have absconded to a secluded corner of a local coffee house sans child or spouse for some serious writing. Because I can barely keep up this year.

I feel like this year won't be that year... And apparently the iPad doesn't want me to write. I can stop now or maybe keep the story going! Starting my writing at 10:30 pm : not a good idea. I hope that means everybody didn't quit. Barrelling along to complete todays 5k challenge and to reach my personal goal of 25K words before tomorrow.

Ending tonight with 28.2k words, so close to 30k that I can almost taste it. You might be easier if my family could take care of themselves! While ideas flood through, I'm oddly at peace. I spent the whole day making art. Now it's 12:56 am, and I'm about to sprint before passing out.

Just barely made my 1k word goal today. didn't hit my 35K goal for the weekend, but I'm close and I only have about 8 scenes left to write! Now I have five. I might just have to put this song on repeat until I finish this draft. I am a gray creature who cannot be forced into a single crevice of definition.

It's very or there, and I'm curious to see how people take it. Someday writing will be my only job. Heading back to the crawl I abandoned last night. Guess I'll roll with it. Definitely not 40K, but at least I wrote today!

Today I am running a fever, swollen throat, hacking bronchitis. I'm writing in the kitchen, where the entire family can keep an eye on me and keep me accountable. Of course I have writers block, of freaking course, less than 3,000 words from the minimum and I can't think. Apparently my word counts tend toward a logaritmic graph, rather than a linear one.

If I can hit 30,000 words before the end of this weekend, that would make life a little easier. Come join me! I have officially crossed the halfway point. I just instantly knew who my character would be played by in a movie Wow.

Only wrote 500 today BUT I did write. I'm a bit behind but still writing :) Last night, I had one of those "my book sucks" moments. The possibility of getting to eat chocolate if I reach my word goal for the day is propelling me forwards. I'm halfway through this book, and the major plot hasn't even happened yet.

I didn't quite write 5k tonight, but I do have school in the morning... I'll be at 25K once the evening's through. I fell reeeeaaally far behind this week. I'm gonna watch Castle. You tried to conquer me but I wrote 2,777 words in the face of your hostility.

Go me. Losing my rag here... Apparently, I can type 2000 words an hour. tiny girl won't get off of my lap. Now I have to play Magnum PI in the background on Netflix to honor Glen A. Larson. But I wrote 2,000 words today.

And as soon as I figure out how to post it, I'll put it up in the room. I actually didn't think I'd make it this far. Yes, I'm that far behind. Of course when I want to get some writing done my computer just doesn't work. I really, really don't want to write right now.

I've got a midway goal to meet! Sent my 2nd novel off to a literary agent. I'm not that far behind thankfully. Gotta kill my word count this weekend! I'm gonna be the kind of slacker that dribbles in a few words here and there, then writes an entire novel in the last two weeks.

I'll complete it tomorrow. I've seen it. I think I've become way too attached to my characters. Back up to having a fighting chance with my word count! And my main character just pissed off the alien Queen. I'm 4,339 words behind par and I only have an half an hour of time I can spend writing today.

23,498 is my word count so far today. I'm only at 19,900! I would like to blame it on the bossa nova, but I do need to write. I have one little green bar again.

This is turning into a book I can't put down! Just me? I've been writing for two hours, but still haven't cracked 2K in that time. Even though I have to be up early, I think I'll keep writing.

I'm 16k behind and I've dug a hole so deep I can't see the light anymore. Everything I try to do... SLEEPING What am I doing? Scraped together some time this afternoon to write and hit my daily goal!

For every 1k words I write, I seem to be gaining a lb in weight! I think tomorrow I'll start off by reading The Slow Regard Of Silent Things. Not that I'm anywhere near halfway done with my novel.

I : Sit your butt down and write! It took me way too long but I am at 37k. and we'll see where I can go from there. I might actually finish this thing! Netflix time with the boyfriend is my reward! I'm nearly caught up.

I am DOING it! Halfway through November, you count your words, and I forget to write mine, 25,000 seems so far away. 353 words left to achieve my' official' target... Attempting to TRIPLE DOWN on my word count today! I pledge my word! I'm at work, smiling and feel alive.

Due to things beyond my control, I started an hour and a half late. I am DOING it! I didn't plan it that way, but it's that way so far.

I made so much progress yesterday and now I can't get anything done, especially writing because of this stupid headache. I intend to write like the wind... I can make that up, though, yes? Why do I let myself get so far behing?

I'm writing a paper for school and got three sentences typed thus far. I wrote absolutely nothing today, but I feel like my cold has gone away.

And I have to get up ridiculously early tomorrow. Finishing my Buffy essay today. Nag me or inspire me... I'm dangerously close to facing my writing enemy : rushing the plot too fast.

So tired I'm actually dizzy. And now I'm caught up. I find it easier to write about murder than to describe my MC's living room. My word count is already at 2500 for the day and I'm not even close to done! I'll have a lot more late nights to come for this book.

In rewritting and all that shit I now have 8,000 words. The blue dye is in my hair. Why didn't I think of this before? At least then I get a better feel for their personalities.

I'm writing a whole section of my book that I have no idea if it will make the final cut but whatever. I just signed on and saw this! Now she's getting punished...why do my characters do this to themselves? I know I'm a day behind, but I finally broke 20k!

Running a spell check so I can see the grade level at the end? I got to over 15k and refuse to beat a dead horse right now. And yes, I'm plinking away at my word count on my phone. Excuse me, new novel idea.

Not that I'm anywhere near halfway done with my novel. I'm back on track! Getting closer to my 3k goal for tonight. I've decided that I'm not writing today. Less than 500 words left til' I reach my word goal for NaNoWriMo! Only 10K words so I'm behind schedule.

I've written some words. I'm not at par, but I'm close enough to make up the difference without too much pain. writing down my story is getting urgent. I broke 20K! I am as well but my girls have me busy.

I' ma go do the thing. I know I did! Half way to my goal, but I am making progress. I did it early on but never got an email or anything.

I hope it stresses the reader. Guess What I've been doing all night? After two weeks of just blindly writing whatever came to me, I think I've worked this into a decent storyline. I am getting some Thai food and heading home early to get my write on.

Who's with me? Still a bit behind but I'll catch up today or tomorrow for sure. I need to get on it! Question : would changing my reward threshold to 500 words be better or worse motivation than 1000?

I may hibernate in front if the fireplace and catch up on word count today. hurts my spirit. Thank you, brain, but just cuz I'm looking for creepy words doesn't mean you can then write that we are "stalking up for winter. The goal today is to get to 35k, and it seems much more attainable when I break it down into smaller sessions.




## Chapter 14 ##

Nearly at 34k I feel like I will make my deadline for the 50k!! Wish me luck! Only 191 words this morning, but I think I have had a plot breakthrough... It seems I'm 87 words down on yesterday.

But that doesn't mean I'm going to give up. Wow,so far I've written 9,000 words about a single day. Write for 30 minutes, meet me back here! I need to put down 2,000 words today and I am a bit stuck.

I feel like I've hit a brick wall... It was only a matter of time before I started questioning whether or not I'm really a writer and if fiction is worthy pursuit. It has taken me this long to figure out where my story begins. I wanna see high counts.

This isn't great, but with exams and such, I'm pretty proud to have hit 10k words. I'm actually in the middle of reading the Dresden Files right now. Needed to name a place in my WIP. I want to break five figures by midnight Sunday. My weeks wear me down.

I found the main conflict, except I found it at 20k. After spending way too much time driving back from Minneapolis, I dug in and got to 25,000 words. I hope... I'm halfway to 50k! I got a ton down tonight.

Wait, did I just decide to amputate my main character'a leg? The moment right after a big action scene is always hard for me... I am DOING it! I feel like a total f'ing failure 3.

Just found out that one of my students took "turn off your inner editor" to mean he didn't need any punctuation. I'm in Part II. I swear Im trying to write, but that's The Mummy's Return on tv! Sometimes when I am writing, I forget what's actually happening out there in the real world. 2,000 words and I'm not to the main scene of this part yet.

Been waiting for this since I started writing. I have 2 hours to bang out 2k words. I got 2 new games for this.

And my heroine is just starting to figure out that her sainted mother is actually a super bitch. I'm getting near the end of Act II as well. " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! AND I SHALL. I'm going to print this half puppy tomorrow.

How could I modify this just slightly? I should be writing. I'll be doing a writing sprint at 12:30 Pacific Time (in just over ten minutes). My prime creativity time is at direct odds with my prime exercise time and the time my employer expects me to be awake and sober. I just realized I don't have a main goal for my main character and I'm 27k words in.

I just killed off a main character, something I have never done before. not many but something I didn't expect just happened and I'm excited to find out what happens next. There is something I must write! I can't believe it's already half over.

That's less than I wrote on Day 1. I haven't slept yet... And thus my writing day comes to an end. I need to stop writing in cafes. I broke 40K yesterday so my WC so far is 40,329! But It's a whole new chapter and I should leave it until tomorrow.

I am about half way done with the novel. Got 31,000 words in November, but 52,000 if I include words I did B4 November. Was hoping for about 1500 more, but alas I could not pull it from me today. Scrapped my whole novel and I'm already celebrating the new draft.

I'm now at 26,868 words. I just decided I'm gonna be destroying a character by the end of this book and I'm super excited to do this. And I've lost all my plot notes... At 16591 words, I have clawed my way back to only 5000 words behind schedule! I'm getting there... Funny thing is, still have that skip day from early on that I didn't skip.

I am thinking of starting at : 30. I'm still above the Total Word Count Goal for today, so I'm not TOO worried (mostly because I am soooo sleepy. I think I can do this thing... I'm having the week 2 blahs. Still behind, but I'm catching up!

Officially half a day ahead on my word count. Works for me. I have about 20 000 words, which is still slightly behind, but not terrible. Should be glad it's the first time, but am TOTALLY BLOCKED in my story now and doubting every last bit of what I have written.

I advise to write short articles. Wow, I wrote 1,554 words. I was SUPPOSED to split this big chunk between yesterday and today... I am DOING it! I've finally hit a bit of a groove to my story, it's getting exciting and stuff is happening.

After writing for the majority of the afternoon, my first story for NaNo is COMPLETE at 50k! But, the hangover is now receding just in time for me to make an early start on Day 16. I always had a "rush" problem in my writing. But I must resist... I just wrote 2,000 words in a half an hour.

I seriously need to get back to my writing. i've destroyed my plot by trying to outline it and fill in the holes. I'm barely at 24k today. Now I have several short stories that kind of go together...

And now I'm officially half way. I always burn them while I'm writing and now I'm almost out. At this rate I will finish on time. I'm not even a quarter of the way through yet. I swear can any more people stand a few feet from the computer and chat loudly? To my MC : Btw, you will have to kill at least one person fairly soon.

If my characters can beat the odds just in time then so can I! Really busy day, but I managed to write 1209 words on the bus, during my lunch hour, and during my break. I'm still not sure what he's going to do, I shall learn much about him. I just reached 25k, yay for me! Can I stop working and bathing and all that normal stuff during November?

I'm gonna sprint again at : 45 till : 00!!! There's something refreshing about the way the pile of notes grows smaller and smaller each time I complete a plot point. I was on the edge of my seat while writing it. So, I'm pretty sure I've got you beat in the slow department.

It's dark, rainy, cozy, writey weather and I'm pounding the hell out of this book. Now just one problem : How to shut my mind up while I have to work or sleep? I thought this would be a Middle Grade fantasy but I might end up making it an adult one. I don't think I'm getting much writing done today.

Who's writing with me? I vowed to never use' ephemeral' after a particular episode of Teen Wolf, yet I finally found the right place for it. I'm so tired, woke up so early, but I have... I was ready to confront the Sky Kraken.

I didn't meet my goal today. Fueling up with some chinese food, then hunkering down to put in as many words as I can tonight. It's either I love my story or I hate it. I really want to make a map of my city in To Look Skyward.

I made a dent today. I got about 1200 words done last night, introduced two new characters. Focusing on different projects which is killing nano for me but I'm loving the change back and forth? But I'm not getting lunch until I break 40K! I cleaned three houses today...for my day job and still managed to meet my daily word goal of 1667 words. Well, so far I've done 1,869 words and I've got to stop to get ready for work.

Everything I get now will be over 1667! I'm surprised how well it went! I lost the handwritten pages I had to write while my computer was down. Thanks to my husband for reminding me of this.

I'm learning, if I write straight through it, I can do about 1k every 20 minutes. Well, maybe I can use this time I unexpectedly have to try to get the day's quota written before everyone comes home! I want a NaNoWriLife. Who is up for sprinting with me? I need to finish this novel so I can stop being a little stress ball about it.

Now if I only knew the rest of the story... Following along with someone doing a beta reading of my first nano for this year. Would it be wrong to use the pen name Nick Sparks for a story about my love of a small personal computer entitled "The Netbook"? I got this! I'm 499 little words away from having 15,000 and it's more than I thought I'd have at this point.

A little over halfway through the month, a little over halfway through my word count. I'm telling myself that I'm not going to write anymore tonight, but we all know that isn't going to happen. I'll follow you back and be your cheerleader! I will not be discouraged even with a very busy weekend ahead. I think I'm ready to call this chapter done.

Hopefully tomorrow I can make a dent in that. I have great ideas but actually pulling the words out is killing me slowly... Tomorrow I want to work on my SEKRIT PROJECT, though. Okay, back to pushing myself in my writing for my last 2 hours tonight...

Now to REALLY build a cushion so that I'm not noveling in a tryptophan haze. I'm off to bed. I wrote so few words, I didn't even add them up and add it to my word count.

And I'm finally seeing the light again. Might even be able to spend a little time with my family! For the 1st time since Nov 1, I did NOT write yesterday. And then I accidentally made my 2 mc's adopted sisters and my entire plan for this story came to a screeching halt. Passed 20.000 words, but I am behind of my personal goal of 25k.

I have a very functional HP' 07 at home. Thanks to the very helpful LA Lemurs I hit 5k for the day and am back on track with 25k words. just have to keep reminding myself why I started. The hubs and I are settled in at either end of the "dining room" table. When everyone goes to a bar to watch The Game, and I'm left alone to get some words onto my screen...

Have I atoned for not writing much this week? I've made it to 8193 and still might have a few more in me. I'm getting to a juicy part in the story. ...Well, neither did I! I say I'm sufficiently hungry. I was listening to the playlist I made for "John" and started crying in the car.

I'm ready for CH 15. I can definitely get 50k words on paper, but that won't really mean the completion of my first draft. Wish me luck. I have LOTS of ideas! I might be behind, but I can see 10K in my future this morning.

Nope, just my input? But today I broke through to new inspiration. I've hit my half way point. I've been procrastinating too much today.

That means I have to write like 5000 words today. I'll fix it to fit later. I literally lost about 500 words today due to a massive plot change. THIS is the book I've been trying to write for a year now. Thanks for link, will take a closer look as soon as I've completed my 50,000 words for November.

I'm stuck at home, I'd like to know what I'm missing. But I don't want to be panicking last minute.. Actually working out of my real office today. I've spent most of my day hiding in Mom's room with my laptop doing so much writing.

No power in the verse can stop me, except running out of tea. I have invented a new word : "guardener". I wrote HALF LIFE, my 4th novel, in 28 days, start to finish. No words so far today, but my garage has a floor for the first time in years!

If I keep this pace up, I'll certainly make 50,000 words by the 31st. I'm ahead at 31.5k words but I still want to type today, even though I have taken a weekend trip to see family in New Hampshire. I just wanna sleep now. I should be on track to hit halfway by Sunday. Did I miss a few days?

this chapter is 22 pages so far and it's not done omg I'm so sorry in advance to my readers. My word count is crawling along today, like I've suddenly defied the laws of mathematics. 2032 words so far, to bring me to 39052. Glad I hit the wall with a high count and sixteen days left.

My laptop battery took a shit without telling me of it's plans to do so. I can totally do this. I'm going to write like a maniac tonight. just about to try out my new standing desk. I love it when everything lines up and you get little hints from the universe that you are on the right path!

I have to hit 25,000 words by tomorrow. But I did make 266 new words. I just made my main character blind and I don't know what to do with that. 79 full pages I smiled...because I've never gotten this far..

I've pushed my word count over 79,000. But hey, I'm still not behind on my word count. Not sure where I'm going next. I hope you're all finding time in to hit your goal today!!! Yeaaaah, Madame Barista, I'm TOTALLY, DEFINITELY FOR SURE giving this second, free Starbucks drink to a friend.

36,527 and my hands won't stop shaking every few minutes. Hoping to get my last 10k done on Sunday. Wish me luck! I'll be starting my first 5k sprint tonight at 10:30 UTC if anyone wants to join me. I'm havinf a week two struggle mostly thanks to my work schedule but next week I'm off for 8 days so I should be able to finish.

Slightly below my goal, but that just about 3 times as many words as yesterday! I just breathed new life into my story by giving it a new one! Not a single doughnut in the story, but I did have one for breakfast! I will not turn the Wizard into Malcolm Tucker. Can somebody please keep an eye on my characters while I'm gone? I wrote so few words, I didn't even add them up and add it to my word count.

In the last two hours I have written approximately 1,095 words... I' m... Nearly 6pm and I still have to start peeing 5k words... I am really liking MS Office Online right now.

She wrote 25,000 words in a month and I have trouble writing like 10... I got over the 25k mark!!! I really want to start writing my third novel idea... If anyone wants to join me, please do!

Must complete 10k before my birthday at midnight!!!! Technically at 13497 I have to get in about 7000 more words to be technically caught up Not sure I'll be able to do that tonight. I stroke out the bullets as points are written in or discarded. Send me your word counts and Hogwarts house! Omg. I realized I am every further behind than I thought.

I love the word "suddenly. Ugh not been able to write for a few days so I gotta schedule that time in tomorrow. I have 0 plot. And another thousand words fill my page, onward! I am so far behind!

I've had it. Hopefully I can get a few more words in before I go to sleep. Guess I'll write for a little before I cave to the siren call of my pillow. 300 more words to hit minimum count for my next day.

A much needed boost in my word count! Don't know why it took me so long to realise this, but writing goes a lot better and faster when you know what's coming next. Is it possible for me to get to 25K tonight? I'm thinking maybe write for 40 mins? I am behind my personal quota.

Whatever you do, don't ask me what my story is about. Who wants to write my novel for me??? Tell me I wanna know. I just reached the point where a character wants me to verb "yolo".

And I like what I found. I spent a day happy dancing, then went back to the keyboard. Holy crap, I may have just come up with a really interesting twist for my story. I've got 31,071 words! That's exactly what my story needs.

I'm about par. And I'm ready to walk out the door to church. If I continue to make up words I could probably get to 30k today. I'm just suffering from too much meh and ehhh.

Still going slow but I mean technically I'm taking a few days "off"... All I want is to get to 1k this morning but stuff keeps pulling me away from the laptop. I have one almost complete shirt and one almost complete pencil skirt. I need rest, the spririt is willing, but my hands are spongy and bruised.




## Chapter 15 ##

I found me a better pen... I just find it interesting. I'm back to do more writing!! I'm loving my secondary characters more and more.

Not writing a romance, but my main character just had the best first date ever. I'd love to promote your book for free! A quick bike ride and my 6pm sprint has me up to 1085 for the day. I love this time of year.

Need a break free of characters demanding "me time. What I love most about writing, is that you somehow end up googling ginger cats named Napoleon and it all makes sense. I'd love to promote your book for free! I just figured out what Part 2 will entail and I am so excited to watch it unfold. I'd love to promote your book for free! I'm at the point I just don't care about this story any more.

Oh I've forgotten the joy of writing the mind of someone who gets to hear the harder styles for the first time.. I need to clean my house. so, I'm looking for a couple of experienced beta readers for my new ms. Internet, for many reasons you are making me bawl tonight. OK, writing marathon here I come.

Been a great day so far, managed to reach all my goals up to this point! after I go write 2k more. I'm really falling in love with my novel. I feel like a detective in the middle of my own story! I will write 4K more before bed.

never thought i'd fit in a lion AND crocodile attack into my story. I have officially made so many spelling errors in my Word document that it can't deal with them any longer. I hope tomorrow is more creative thanks to the night off. I got some more time to write and hit word 20,052.

It won't last, but I love it! But I'm excited. One more day should see me there. Okay, I'm done procrastinating.

I'm okay with that. Ok, I give in to my wrist. I'm so excited. New goal : just beat my word count last year lol.

I love being in denial the author way. I wish my characters would talk more. More importantly, deadlines drive me. Nothing makes me feel more accomplished than locking in chapters. I managed to lose about an hour's worth of writing.

Had my best writing day of the month yet, with 7.6k written, bringing my total up to 64,283 words! 1668 words today and I don't think I'm getting any more tonight. I'm really happy with the progress and trying not to think of the long tunnel of editing to come. I'd call it a success.

Okay, can I hit 30k this evening? If I make it to 25k by midnight, I am both a full day ahead and officially halfway done! (I'm not crazy I swear)

Ok twitter, I'm here for sprints. Going to write many words this weekend to catch up to my goal. 16th November : HOW ARE THERE STILL 15 DAYS TO GO I CANT TAKE THIS ANY MORE. Writing this book feels like the most important thing in my life right now. Concerned because thought was short on words but found out I'm good. Not as much as I wanted, but good enough to sleep on it!

Five more minutes of writing before I run off. I'm using more tissues than I'm writing words. I am excited to get to the' reveal' at the end of this story. I guess because I'm doing the literary equivalent of that, and it's inspiring me.

I sure home the night of writing dangerously isn't cold! Ok, I am stuck and I have no motivation to write... I JUST NEED 951 MORE WORDS. Luckily I'm almost at 50,000 words. Following her for a better plot than I started with! Let's see if I remain on track for more than 24h this time. Working at Dad' s. But keep thinking about these girls and whether they'll kiss (or more) when I get home.

Okay, I am hella close to 28k, but it's also hella close to 4am. I need more time and energy. I just typed 20k words, and my original goal for this month is 25k. Ok, I've been busy with everything else all day.

Because my MC is worth it. Oh hello extra 200 words that I didn't think I had in me tonight, so nice to see you there! And my love. just 200 more words to write to meet my goal.

All of a sudden my villain started talking and I was like,' I kind of like this person. Sweet mother of Celestia, I can't believe I did it. MC on a great adventure right now and all I can think is how much I want to travel his route. I think it's more of a challenge. I love it when a plan comes together.

All my old favorites to get me through 2000 more words. YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I DIDI! I have more that I could write, but I'm saving the words for tomorrow. Ok I'll just go to sleep on that.

I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get 50k by tomorrow night. This novel is a LABOR of love and boy am I laboring tonight. I'm so freaking excited. 1500 more words to write to hit my goal of the day.

If I don't do that again I'll be fine. Saved me so many times this novel. No I fucking won't. I napped before, so I fine on sleep!

I'm really excited about this project. I love that moment when something new in the story clicks. Anyone make more than me?

I'm not super happy with the story, will take a lot of editing, but I'm continuing to write! I just wrote my favorite scene in my novel yet. Just realized that 2 stories in a row I've mentioned bird poop on the very first page. " I really, truly love this word. Didn't make a full 1667 today, but with a 12 hr work day and a headcold, I feel good about 1400 or so.

If I can just get over this 25,000 hump I am almost positive I can win. :)) I aaaaam x. I wrote 800 words tonight, which is good enough for me. To kill or not to kill, that is the writing dilemma I am having right now.

Do I think logically that I will be able to hit 20K today? I'm more than halfway through the novel now... Pretty confidant I'll finish! That seems too quick for the falling in love I'm aiming for. also love that the characteristics I had planned for both of these kids basically swapped somehow...

I'm going for 40K right now. My greatest failure as a writer may be the inability to hang on to a flash drive to save my life. I have made a deal with myself : if I hit the 25, 000 mark by midnight tonight, I can buy Super Smash Bros tomorrow! I just said "3 more people must die for me to finish my novel. I have no regrets over a wonderful evening with friends, or getting the leaves raked.

One scene is now locked into the draft, and I'm pretty happy with it. I typed 6591 words to my story today, beating my personal best. What I really ought to do is try to write more. Today's "Word I couldn't spell right on the first try" : "Ecstasy.

I know next to nothing about Facebook, so imagine my joy when it suddenly became a feature in my novel. Good thing I don't have a class' til ten. I wonder how many hours I would have to put in to finish my novel today? Although I had no motivation earlier, once I started writing I got into a real nice groove and wrote some good stuff.

Lovin' the chapter I'm on, and still super excited about this story. My favorite line of my novel : "You look like a giraffe climbing a tree. I think it's worth it. People have been attempting to convince me to get an apple laptop instead of my huge iMac. Let's see if I can do better while it's brewing.

First one I've liked this much since I published Jute. Let's see if I remain on track for more than 24h this time. Why can't I go back to my first year of NaNo where I was happy writing 4k on cleaning the house just to make up words? Surely I could quite.

Get ready to hear a lot of Livin' on a Prayer jokes because I am halfway there! the trick for me won't be getting to 50k, the trick is getting to the cool ending I planned. I'd love to promote your book for free! I think that is more than deserving of a wine.

I kind of love writing this amoral dragon character. get in my daily 2k words without effort, that'd be great, thx. I made my "Words Per Day To Finish On Time" wordcount for the first time in a week tonight.

I wrote almost five thousand words today, so yes, I am fucking fabulous, thank you for noticing. I'll do better tomorrow. If I can stay conscious, I might be able to get to 30K tonight after the kids are in bed. knocked out about 800 words this morning, which isn't bad considering my brain is not awake yet. I love when my own story surprises me.

I'm still writing strong! How many watchlists am I on now? Gosh, I'm loving this book so much. Think I just made some new adventurous, insecure, creative best friends! But I'm estimating about 20K more until the book is actually finished.

Dropped my first Jane Eyre reference 21,000 words in. Text from a friend yesterday : "I don't understand your group writing things but I think it's cool. Most of the time I find myself thinking "Eh... Best Friday night word count so far but my pillow is calling now.

I never know where to fit them in my story. Now I need a suitable distraction. I've literally been writing all day and I think that's fantastic. Didn't think I'd get much writing done on vacation in Florida, but I just hit 30,000 words! I have thought of a brilliant way to make life harder for my MCs. Not so sure, but I'm loving the story that's unfolding.

And when I open them, I expect there to be 860 more words in this document. I think women are interesting characters, because their stories are rarely told. Despite my best intensions, this busy weekend has thrown me off.

I can write 422 more words, right? Let's see if I remain on track for more than 24h this time. I'm very interrested to see what you've been writting about! I think that is more than deserving of a wine.

I celebrated by eating too many golden Oreos and ribbon candy. Pretty sure a bit of the 2k that I wrote today is more of an info dump (and less of a book), but this is so much fun! Apparently there are times when I write best if I'm listening to One Direction...

I just spelled "Uncharacteristically" correct on the first try. Lucky I am a day ahead. Okay, I'm making you guys a promise. WOW I am so happy and I still want to keep writing!

I LOST A WEEK'S WORTH OF WORDS?!? Okay, now that I've had some sugary sustenance, it's time to write. Snuggling with my Onsie right now whilst doing some evening writing. " Gee, I sure wish the author had described the main character's hair colour, "said no reader ever. I think that is more than deserving of a wine.

I just spelled "exasperatedly" correctly on the first try. I'm super scientific. okay, you got me. The problem with stopping my wordcount on a sexy palindrome is that I don't want to write more!

" He knelt at a rose bush and did something deep and meaningful that makes me seem like an awesome writer. I love NaNo. I'm pretty sure I'm a superhero. I've just reached my first 50k words! That's exactly what my story needs.

But now that most of the Krimmer camp is up, not looking like I'll go much over 1K. Why do you all have so many words and where's my motivation? I hate MOST of my first drafts, so its always nice to write a sentence that makes me happy. " "Oh, I thought I was being original. I can't stop writing, this is fantastic!

I know I'm not supposed to edit but can I rewrite an already written scene on another file without editing the original? 30,000 words and thinking I'll probably write more than 50,000. going pretty well for my first year! Think I just made some new adventurous, insecure, creative best friends! I better get writing 14,00 words done, just 36,00 more to go!

I won't be able to write all day so I'm glad I've got that buffer! Doing better than I thought I was, I guess. 18k and I'm suddenly excited about my plot again. I'm going to pretend that it's okay I'm still in my pjamas and it's nearly 12. First day I've met the target word count.

If you're stumped, ask yourself,' What inspired me in the first place? Tomorrow night is queued up for writing and I should be fresh. Oh my word this novel just got exciting! okay, you got me. Awesome, now to finish my story and maybe start a new one.

he gave me nightmares with Christine and paranoid about cars, haha! I'm stopping in the middle of a good part so I can pick it right up tomorrow. Be sure to send me an email if u'd like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K! I told my best friend about the plot today and she got so insanely excited which made me excited.

Back on track now :) and getting more into my comfort zone. Could I have added 11 more to make it 23K? I stopped at exactly 40k words tonight. I am so excited. " Okay look, I don't care if you weren't listening, but you can't just say' Oh' as if you're baiting me for a reply.

I am excited. Yesterday was my most productive day, writing 5000 words. " Well, my love, now you'll taste the privileges of being a White! When I believe I'm writing it for me and only me, it's always better! And I must say, your app came in quite handy for my research.

I'm really struggling right now. I tried to google this but found nothing useful. Too much fun playing with "Ginnie me! I may have to take a nap and wake up to write more. Today is a "Listen to Disturbed while I write about demons and Thrift Store Mechs" kind of day.

I'm totally loving this Google Docs thing for people critiqueing my book. It's awesome to see a string of completed story drafts in my recent Google docs. Haven't written anything yet today but my head is full of story! Luckily I have the control. I'd love to go back to bed right now, but, you know, this novel won't write itself. Okay, I've been super distracted this morning but I'm going to attempt to write for half an hour then head to work.

And I was so sure it was a good idea on Friday. I'll do better tomorrow. Yesterday's break was exactly what I needed! Super early morning writing with tea by my side.

I had to use a bigger binder clip on my WIP (work in progress) this a.m. That's a good sign, right? From here on out, this is the most words I've written for one thing. I should probably have done that first but oh well. will never run out of things to clean, so here I need to stop and say, "this is good enough, now get those words out. Now I'm in my favorite place on the planet : bed.

I will not cry at my own fic. Got through it, but it ate a bit more time than I like. The next book I write will have to be set somewhere bright and sunny. I am at fakey fakey right now. I'm really caffeinated.

Don't know how much writing I'll get done. Almost to the scene I envisioned during the first day of planning! Getting to know my characters a bit better now. I'll be honest.

A warm shower is my just reward. I've had a pretty good writing day considering all the stuff I've been doing today. These moments are rare for me. I feel quite accomplished.

However, I am fast becoming an night owl. I'd love to promote your book for free! I no longer the Knights of NaNoWriMo is overly pretty, the slavers are a pantser's plo... Okay really tho, Im restraining myself from screaming because I dont wanna freak out my parents. Guess I'd better get a couple hundred words in before bed.

It would be so much easier if there were three of me. the abuse Winter hurls at herself during her anxiety attack is almost exactly what I say to myself during mine... I'll just have a quick scroll through my Twitter feed...it will help motivate me. I hit 56k today and going strong toward the finish. but I'm sure gonna try. I'm on kind of a roll, but my mama is taking me to see Theory of Everything, so...

Now I can crawl off to bed happy and let my tired brain rest. Got more words in the bank today already than I did the whole of yesterday... I knit it myself but it's Ryan so it won't even be warm.

During that paragraph I get the most intense ice pick head ache I've gotten in weeks. Today my story seemed to take it's own course, I was just along for the ride. Most of me wants to go home and pass out. I had to kill someone I had really grown to like this morning. I'm full of encouragement today. Good thing I love it.

But it's a mess I'm proud of. Sure mom I'll go to bed before 10:00... 5 more lines left to write then I have to count my words up. I'm full of encouragement today. With two of them, the odds were much better they could keep me in line if I lost it again.




## Chapter 16 ##

" I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! At 37k and am hoping I have a few more words in me before bedtime. Now am I dead. Slowly realizing that all of my male characters have younger sisters and all of my female characters have older brothers. It's just now occurring to me that I should have planned the timeline of my plot a little better.

I thought I was going to slow down after reaching 50K yesterday. I think I may have exceeded expectations this month. Wondering if this comfy seat drains my brain's ability to remember things... 13,800 words in, I throw my main character out a window.

What shall I do? Maybe I'm inspired to add a few more... Seeing a few Tweets pass my way on it. Last year on day 14 I did 9500 in a single night. Makes me glad I added a 2nd blanket to my bed last week!

Maybe I'll just skip to arc three after this scene. I've written all the exciting parts of my story, now I just need to fill in the gaps.I'm low on inspiration. Only 12.5k behind my goal now, so I am closing that gap. My previous novel was at a dead end, so I decided to start a new one. Only 1,205 words written today (though it's better than 0), putting me at a total of 26,255.

I'm at a stopping point. I just printed out my novel so far. Think my book needs pirates in it. Words are starting to flow out more easily, though I just hit a particularly sad turning point for MC.

I'm getting ready to get this bad boy started. I haven't had a single green day yet! I am DOING it! Only a little behind and loving my story! Only 2K more to go to reach my daily goal!

By tonight, I will have written 25,000 words. I feel an intense action scene with battle axes coming on. Let's see if I can get Lars the cat into some trouble today. No funny lines, but my iPhone keeps changing the word "scrunchie" to "acrubchie. After a couple of days of not writing thanks to my new job, I'm aiming for 26,000 words today.

Wonder what I. This chapter is such a mess, I'd rather do laundry right now. I'm the one who'd be dead by now if looks could kill. I'm at 28k. Suddenly, I know exactly how I'm going to use the Traveling Shovel of Death this year.

First time I've seen Dead Ringer, and quite enjoyed it. I had several ideas for new scenes an hour ago!...Now, what were they?... For me?!? Si, Here I am... Lets get down to business....to increase my word count! I am definitely in the wrong line of work.

' I'm with you on that Hemingway. Woohoo, I'm less than 1,000 words away from 30k! So far : over 28k of 50k words written in my new novel!

I learn more about myself through veering from the plan when writing than other time. Not bad considering I had to get up a few times because of kids and cats messing with things. I only wrote 1955 words 2day. Now I wish I knew how to play an instrument. 34,702 words down, feels like I'm on the home stretch! It took longer than usual, but I'm done for the day.

It won't let me be lazy. A little later than usual, but I did it! Damn you, sickness, thwarting my plans! I wonder how many words an NFL game could yield? The story is coming out nicely for my next visual novel a BXB one.

I HIT WORD COUNT! If I can write 1,500 words before the guys arrive for MTG, I will allow myself to play a few games. Fast forward to this year : I just got IN bed.

I once went through a phase of excessively using "indeed" in my writing. I'm ahead of todays target so time to get to half way stage.. Consequently, I am misspelling' thunder' every. Early morning start on my only day off. I wonder if all the passengers on my tram (aka captive audience) would like to hear about my manuscript.

Why yes, I did just teach myself to blow smoke rings for writing research. I have zero focus and zero willpower apparently. It has been difficult due to personal issues but I can do it. Someone give me a prompt! It just figures that now I'd be struck with an idea for a new book.

Last 1K I wrote, however, is deeply weird. Half way home and my pager still blowing up. Day 14 Starting to feel like I've hit a rut. I actually spent the whole day doing homework... I'm embarrassed to have so much real life in my novel.

This time last year I had 3 villains who's motives I understood. Good golly, I'm so behind. I've hit 22k, ready for day 14 and a weekend of planning the next half of the book! I had the last two days off and managed to do three days worth of work in two so I'm going to take today off.

Whole family sick and I'm running out of bleach wipes. 6,578 words behind today's total quota, but I've almost met the 1,667 word daily quota. I have a feeling a lot of this backstory will be edited out...next month, when I do a rewrite. Where has this been my whole life?

900 words to go, and I am feeling the pressure. I guess that's why it's important to write every day, so I know where I left off at. Finally decided what I want for Christmas. 1 a.m., secretly writing a novel in the dark, under covers, on my iPhone. Didn't think I would get caught up but, yay! after an awesome night of writing dangerously, I am up to 43,334.

Ugh, Just reread my hook chapter and realized that it is a reasonable scenario for 49 states. Cut me, Mick. It seems like I start writing later every night, but at least I'm getting it done every day. November may the worst month to write a novel and go gluten free, but that's okay because I'm insane.

it's very unlike my usual stuff. I hear the young people would say "the struggle is real. There's a whole concrete wall that's been flourishing in front of me for the past few. To get my word count in for today (and go a little over), I drank 2 cups of coffee which is 2 more than normal.

I hear it's super busy. So my new reward is I only get to play it after I get my word count goal done for the day. I HAVE TO write tomorrow! then i shall look back at my work and think "what the fuck am i writing. I have a really hard time accepting that rubber band is two words.

After 2 pm my brain is pretty much like writing? I'm past the midpoint in my first novel and suddenly things are fun again. This always seems to happen around 14,000 for me. I went from being over 5K words behind last week to over a day ahead today. I think I can finish it but it's going to be hard.

I am now onto part two of the book. I wrote nearly 5000 words today. Last 1K I wrote, however, is deeply weird. Oh please, imagination, don't fail me now.

I call this' Ode to the empty bottle of red wine next to me'. I'm at work, smiling and feel alive. Still several thousand words behind, but I made it past 20,000 words today! I do have 2K words ahead of me I want to write. Having my nails painted seems to make writing more fun when it gets slow.

I'm feeling another 5,000 words on the tips of my fingers! 956 words to go until I am completely caught up. Headaches have really left me behind on my word count, looks like I'm pulling another all nighter! Pretty sure I just passed the 23k mark with that last sprint.

For the first time in a while, I'm in the word count range I need to be in. Wish me luck because I WILL FINISH. I will write during my down time at work and when I get home. Still a little behind but I have til Sat night to hit 25k.

I started a scene with 17 people in it and spent my time coming up with their names. Not that I'm anywhere near halfway done with my novel. I made it past 25,000 words in my novel today. Maybe I'll start one. I bought a new pipe too!

31,061 and my editing process is actually netting more words because I'm a horrible human being. Did I write my 1.5K words? Well now that the big wurm has attacked, I need a cool way for our heroes to defeat it... I have taken a small break after reaching 30k words. Now I need to stay up late to get my daily word count. I am DOING it! I got my 25K badge tonight, and though I'm excited, I'm still only halfway.

Had to meet my word quota for today and I did. Much like me! Tomorrow might be hard due to work, but Monday I'm aiming for a 5000 day!! Thank you word sprints, my random writing (all over the place but still in plot) brings me to 20,353 words so far! I'm very inspired by all the people who crossed 50K words tonight!

Ok, I think I can write my ass of and get this last 2k in before 4 AM YEAH?! Have decided to drink some water, since all I have had is coffee so far... " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! I'm so far behind! I'm still plodding along in fits and starts.

I've got more than 45000 wrds to go yet, and only 2 wks to do that in. 20,678 words on my 1st novel so far. I've crossed the finish like yesterday. I've been having trouble writing for 3 days now. I got started late.

So looking back at my life choices, november was the worst possible time to get completely obsessed with Teen Wolf. i have written half of my 50K words... that convo I just added came from out of nowhere and was about my other main character but I think it works... For the first time ever, I am writing a novel in a linear fashion.

I should write at least 10k words but I don't feel like writing. Something in my fridge was growing mold so I wrote a short story about it. May write more later if the mood takes me.

The last scene I wrote was really depressing so I took a longer break and watched Liv and Maddie on Disney, don't judge me. Less than 500 words written and I'm going to bed at 9pm. I really need to buckle down and get writing for my novel. On the up side, if I keep up this pace, that's probably going to be pretty soon.

Even if nothing else happens, at least I met my quota.. Hate how my chart bars stay right on that line! A winner is me! I don't feel like writing today... So far this month, it's been much tougher to get my writing done on the weekends. Once again, the baby wanted to make sure I have plenty of quiet time to write by getting up at 5am.

It was also my least inspired day to write. I've gone to previous chapters and extended scenes. Saying "I lost a day due to helping my mother with the internet" is a valid excuse for not reaching your word count, right? Also, I really want to share Part 2 of my story with you!

After delaying with a lengthy scene in a karaoke bar, I was finally ready! I'm so far behind but I'm feeling good about today. I'm not convinced. Day 14 and I'm over half way! But, at least I managed to catch up on some housework.

So I guess I'll keep going. I said I needed to understand the layout of Paris for my novel, my husband suggested buying the new Assassin's Creed. I'm a little over 900 away from 30k!! I know exactly what I need to say...

Let's see if I can crank out another 2.5K words again today. And realized my lead character may need a new job. I'm at 22.5k words so I am just a little behind. Only like 2K more of writing and I am DONEEEE.

I have teens who are just as annoying but not as cute. In order to finish this book on my birthday, my new per day word goal is 2.4k. I hate myself right now. Listen to me! It was tough, but I'm so proud.

I'm tempted to give up and start a new story, but I'm afraid I'll do the same once I've started that. I know because I am writing new gospels about it. At least I wrote a few hundred words at the auto shop! Not what I was hoping for. I really want to know how this book ends but I have finish writing it first UGH.

3,245 words written today, putting me at 31,253 total. I was really getting into it, too! I'm not entirely sure how... Been camping with my laptop and notebooks in Costa for a few hours now. ...But then this whole 2014 has been about rebuilding my discipline and getting out of my own head and back onto the page...

' Death is always late to a drowning, my dear. I'll try for a little while, see what happens. Not of writing, just tired and wish I had more time. I'm happy with that, and it puts me very firmly beyond the 33k line.

Maybe if I focused more on the story as a whole instead of a daily word count I would get more accomplished. Wanted to be farther along, but I guess for a daily total of over 3.5K I can live. I have words to throw down! Cocoa had knocked thm in2 trash becuz I ws late serving breakfast.

I wish I could write it differently, but that's not how things happened. Cthulhu help me when I have to edit this first draft... The antagonist is so evil he's starting to scare me, is that normal??? It's not a month of novelling madness if I don't break out the Atonement soundtrack for a few days of writing. Hmm, 23336 isn't quite where I'd hoped to be, but it's moving in the right direction.

help me. I wanted to get a little more ahead today, but it was not in the stars... Been letting my efforts slip lately. That's a hole I can dig myself out of, right?

I can catch up, right? Not of writing, just tired and wish I had more time. I just thought if anyone saw my internet search history, I could be in trouble. I at least have a plan.

But how would I know since I don't have time to read it? Writing at a more relaxed pace for now so that my mind can wander a little bit. At least I was caught up for about 24 hours. Not getting any writing done right now because SS4 exists and I'm watching footie.

I hope my other Wrimos had a good count today. I literally vant mm not tuopst. I think I'll get my word count in late tonight.

I could swear I've typed "kill me" at least 25 thousand times. I am just having trouble getting motivated to write today. New daily goal is 2000, which should make it in time if I can meet it every day. I am excited about my most recent scene.

I keep telling myself to shower, or eat, or at least brush my teeth... Now to be lazy for a few hours, cause I deserved it. If I can do 5.5k today (not unreasonable), I'll be back on par! Mainly because I lost time this morning going to the dentist. Today my writing goal is 3 days worth of word counts.

Does somebody want to give me some ideas for my novel' cause I'm fresh out. Now, if only I had artistic talent... I have officially hit The Wall. Sick kids and a homicidal chair derailed me, but I am finally getting back on track. Why am I so slow?

Ok. In 6 minutes, I'm going to start writing. Not as many today because I had to have actual human interaction. I came in late so managed 665. I have not been able to catch up to word count at all this month so far.

I aim to write 15k (hit 25k) by 12am Sunday. " Straightforward is my middle name. I'm a bit late to the party.. slowly bringing my word count to heel, 15,500 words, should really call it a night, good luck fellow Wrimos!!

...but it does mean that I get to hold another halo contest over Thanksgiving Weekend. This whole writing every day thing is ruhl bad for my fingers. I just lost my entire book. But it's pretty cool to see that since this time last week, I've written almost 10,000 words! Conflict of dates, had to make certain my story fit time frame.

I am posting no more pictures through this weekend instead I'm going to go be productive with other things. I need a few writing prompts, if anyone would be so kind... I'd like to be at least at 30k before I leave tomorrow. I want to see 30k today at minimum! I didnt quite reach my 6k words goal for today but 5600 is pretty close.

finally starting to love writing my novel, after 21 thousand words, hooray! 6:36 am, can't sleep even though this couch is super damn comfy, and just had a major idea come to me. Do you think I can do it? I feel like such a fail. trying to reach 20K tonight, not sure if I will make it!




## Chapter 17 ##

I'm going to have an amazing word count today. Tonight my raptor stuffed wads of tissues up his nose...but it was for a really good reason, you guys. I'm already at 34K and I have a feeling it's gonna take 9K more to wrap things up. More writing time when I get home. After Thursday's flatline, it's good to know I didn't lose the mojo.

I just came up with an amazing idea for another novel. I hurt top to bottom. I think it's been a good day.

I will feel so freaking amazing once this mountain of homework is done. I have more than 25k now! Need to put beer in my tea mug more often. This sounds so good, I almost don't want to write anymore.

Loving my newest character. I'd love to promote your book for free! Doing good, I think.

Kicking my own ass like never b4. Has nothing to do with my project, it's just good music. Need more jelly babies to sustain me to the end! Kendrick Lamar makes me want to be a better writer and tell better stories. Okay, I'm done writing for the day. I can NOT write any more without editing and organizing! I didn't say any of them were good...

I'm so excited! My MC just opened up about trauma he experienced and now I'm ready to bawl. Be honest with me... All I am saying is the more the merrier, people and words alike! Doing so good at procrastinating today, I've decided to take the day off.

It's a,' I'm just going to swallow my gum,' kind of day. We had two good weeks, my friend. Just wrote another 500ish words, so I'm catching up. Mostly' focused' free writing, for me. Gotta run on my own. I'm good with that.

I am freaking out honestly. Need more jelly babies to sustain me to the end! Made it to 25k yesterday, and I'm still feeling pretty good about this story. I was thinking of having something happen to my MC to ruin her good mood, but...

That kind of blows my mind. I need a good mob family name. I'm toying with the idea of killing a character but they're kind of integral to the plot? 16,720 total words, and I am feeling pretty marvelous. I will not cry at my own fic. If what I'm writing is any good won't be known until editing.

I dream of catching up this weekend. Unless I get a good blast of words on our boat this weekend, I won't make it. And I love it. Two days of food poisoning means I haven't been able to sit vertically let alone write anything. Took a good part of the day outline the rest of my novel.

I know that writing 907 words when I am depressed and cannot put 5 thoughts together is huge... I'll go one more hour. I'd need to make sure to be home before dinner, tho! I think this sounds like a good plan.

Someone light a fire under my butt... My book was better before I wrote it... Then I'll write more! ohhhh my book is good to me.

So many plot inconsistences but I can't change them till December. Hope the rest of you are doing better than me! I don't ogle good looking guys, I surreptitiously glance and then put them in my novel. I'm glad you powered through. Got my jet fuel (name of the coffee), my blanket, and amazing direction for HOH2. Will I ever reveal whether or not labeling my novel as' Erotic' is just for irony?

I'm super fucking great at procrastination. JK :) I will beat this novel into submission (pun intended)! I know, I'm making no sense, but I'm super excited about exploding plot points! Happy I Love to Write day!

I am killing it right now! Okay, I've made my minimum word count goal for today. I'd love to promote your book for free! Safe to say that I'm getting SSB tomorrow! I'd say it's a fair trade.

I would love to tell your story. I still consider 20k in 11 days to be pretty awesome though. Going to try for 16,000 before I go to sleep which should be easy. I love basketball. Did I get some good stuff done?

Hey girl, the perfect end to any day is one where you read me excerpts of your latest writing project. I accidentally wrote a thousand words more so I'm at 23k now! I love it when a plan comes together. Does it count as a sex scene if my character is getting off on murdering a room full of murder fetishists?

Feedback you don't want from your reading group : "I love that you went with spiral binding this time. I found a really good chill out playlist on Spotify that's great for writing. One more day off the clock, I think, before I start tackling my remaining word count. Not bad considering I had to go in to work. But I won't be able to keep up this rate for the rest of the month. Let's be honest, I was going anyway!

Alright, laptop, stop having a bitch fit for like 5 mins and let me get some work done! :) I'm procrastinating again! (Fortunately I am ahead anyway...) These characters love to talk and will not let me stop writing. Woke up with "Go the Distance" from Hercules stuck in my head...today will be a good word count day.

If I can most of the beats done today, I'll have a fairly steady time till the end. " Justice for Katie "is going well, word count is at 32K and I'm more excited the more I write. I think i might actually be able to do this. Having my writing slump break this morning was amazing. I have some catching up to do, but I had another good day. I feel a nice glass of celebratory wine is in order!

Lucky for me I was well ahead. " I have to find a way to sort of let him know without saying it in so many words... Why can't I be one of those writers who has a perfect first draft? I'm catching up though!

I understood the screams of my victims, and the cries of their loved ones when the bodies were found. Despite my PC having a virus, I managed more than 3,000 words today! Would have wrote more, but I was questioned A LOT as a suspect. First time I've written a fight scene this detailed.

By the end of today, I should be able to start up again (though at a slower clip). Need more jelly babies to sustain me to the end! I had a pretty crappy day, so it's time write a really great short! Keep at it, then ship it :) It's what I've had to do. Then I laughed it off.

How many words can I write before the water boils? This is not going to be good for my word count. Super excited with today's word count of 2869 I managed after working and doing some house work too. Now I'm even more excited myself! So I just do my own!

A Noveltini and witty banter await me... That's two days in hand, which is good as I'm going to need them. " I learnt a lot about myself in the 10 minutes it took to die "I love this line. I guess not being able to sleep is a good thing, means I can catch up!

I don't think I'm gonna be able to write 10k but 5k would be an awesome goal for me. Having a great time in Brooklyn with beautiful people but I really just want to write. I'm feeling pretty good about moving forward now. I love writing new fiction first thing in the morning.

Sundays seem to be my best day for writing, not too sure why. I hope to do more after I get home from work. I should write, right?

I'm so glad that "the" counts as a word. Right now, my characters are discussing why free range unicorns are banned. LOVING my story!

Tell me more. Glad I got on board just before the Go time! Muse don't fail me now! I slacked a couple days but I'm still ahead, so all is good.

Almost to the Pivotal Scene that spurs my third act. I have more, but pacing is important. I have cheerfully passed 30K, I am deliriously happy, it's 4 in the morning and I'm GOING TO SLEEP. I'd say today was a successful day of writing.

Jumping between scenes means I get to kill a MC 1 minute then write a comical argument the next. Really pleased I managed to do this much! I'd love to promote your book for free! Now I just have to do that 24 more times, and I'll be caught up! I'm catching up, I've written over 3000 words today!

I gotta say, that feels pretty damn good. I would have typed more but my fingers are frozen! Writing in the kitchen is my new favorite thing. " (I didn't write that, but it's still totally appropriate.) I can still' win' if I can write 2400 words per day for 14 more days.

Lucky to have teenagers I can leave to their own devices. I'm jealous even though I'm happy in love. I really enjoy this side character and wish I could write him more, but I can't' cause, you know, he DIES. What a great supportive family I have.

But I feel a strong stagnation in my flow. I've written more than you across the years! I'm still way behind, but making progress and it feels great! The more I write, the more it becomes habit. I'm good with that.

But that's fine by me. I love writing! Right after I feed the cats. I guess we'll see if I manage to get any more done. I've been good today but I've still got some catching up to do.

I'd better go write to make up for this atrocity!! Need more jelly babies to sustain me to the end! Ok, on that sprint I got 316. Might squeeze in some words if I'm lucky. 33,011 and I don't know if I'm on a roll or not, but I've certainly climbed over a hurdle.

Got draws FULL of notepads with my early novel scribblings. Hopefully I can work just as quick before the gym this evening. I didn't do any writing at all yesterday and I'm bummed about it way more than I should be. Better finish the bag before I try again! OK, HERE I GO!!

I plan to ponder this plot some more while I deal with this commute. This is actually amazing for me! I have one more after this one. I really needed some me time tonight. Learning more about my characters and where the story is going. Let's see how many I can get done!!

I'm glad my brain is on salary, I couldn't afford to pay it hourly. Good job, me. I sure hope we both end up at the same spot. I am seriously having the best day of writing since day 1. I OWN it!

I'm considering going through my novel and editing my contractions to make the full two words. Good day for staying warm, listening to music and working on my story. This being true, I've raised procrastination to an art form. Good day for staying warm, listening to music and working on my story.

I'd better go write to make up for this atrocity!! Using my nephew's poem in my book (love it!) Thank goodness I have an adorable love interest blooming to offset the rest of the doom. I'm at 27.8K ish right now! I actually feel more like editing than I feel like writing. I'm still going to try to write at lunch but I don't remember exactly where I left off...

Excuse my while I award myself a medal for being so awesome. Not as good of a writing day as I would like, but 20,835 words to date is still pretty darn good! But at least I'm doing some good works there. Just when I thought I had hit a wall I got a great idea for a subplot that's helping.

Early today I wrote myself into a rut.... Thank you very much constipation advert, ruining my train of thought in my chapter. I'm excited to be sooo close to the end! I will not cry at my own fic... I'm making great progress but must balance it with revisions.

I may not be up to speed, but I think I'm catching up pretty well. I'll own it. I feel very positive about the future. I am a happy girl, except I need 3K words today.

Good thing I've managed to keep up... I've still got some catching up to do... Hitting a word count milestone should surround me with a halo of light. I wrote a first person POV. I'll find ya.

Think I just made some new adventurous, insecure, creative best friends! Works better with longer sentences and is way faster than my fingers! Think I just made some new adventurous, insecure, creative best friends! Sure taught me a lesson!

Youngest cat is beside the computer, oldest is draped over my shoulders. Also, I seem to have dialogue and forward momentum, which is always useful. I novel better when I'm in musicals. Lol, I said I was going to be taking a break today, but I ended up writing 3246 words.

I'll definitely win, but I don't think I'll hit 80K before the Codex deadline. I Love Bar Graphs! I'm ok with that. my new story is about girls who fall in love of after meeting in a museum. I hit 45,000 words on the train, but I am fading fast. I think I'm done with writing for tonight.

Fixing a scene that I wrote earlier today. The first line of my 100th page : "She kissed him. And more to write before I sleep. I am heartbroken and happy.

More importantly, brought my total up to 23.1K. Though I suppose that's kind of the point at the moment... Not that I'm anywhere near halfway done with my novel. I'm unbelievably excited. This full time writing thing is making me very good at putting in eye drops.

Let's see if I can hit 2k! I really want to read a book instead of write one, just for a night... I'm catching up, I might be able to get back on track. I'm kind of at that point of the month where I'm wondering why I'm doing this. I am probably inordinately proud of my book, I am not stopping at 50,000 I'm just going to keep going.




## Chapter 18 ##

" The words I was thinking of weren't nearly so kind. 25080 words.Half way to done with this terrible but oddly compelling (to me) fiction. I stopped at 22,222 words last nite.

I am a mean, mean, mean writer person. This brings me to a little over halfway to my goal for today. Past my par for today! With a little luck and some diligence at the keyboard, I should finish the WIP tomorrow night.

I'm late. It's 11 p.m., and I'm dead tired, but it's time to write! Just about made it at 1024 but I'm set for the scene!

I'm not sure what's wrong with me. Just in case writing a novel sounds as pretentious as I think it does, let me assure you that mine sucks! I stepped away for no more than two minutes and I've lost 800 words what the fudge! In case I haven't said it already, writing is hard. By cheating EVER SO SLIGHTLY and counting the words written after midnight as yesterday' s, I AM NOW OFFICIALLY ON PAR AGAIN! I made it!

I've made it past the 50000 mark! With all the trips I've taken the past few weeks, I haven't had time to turn on my home computer. It's like CHRISTMAS, I can hardly sleep! I'm a bit late I gotta catch up. I think I'm still slightly reeling from that wordcount.

Hopefully I'll hit 1k if not more! 2767 words on the day, less that I had hoped for but not too shabby, either. I mean 50k. I know what goes down.

Usually when I get addicted to a book, I stay up way too late reading it. I've been handwriting my notes the past few days. I'm like 10k behind, so I've got some serious making up to do. ...what if my novel sucks?? That now leaves me really far behind on WC.

" I melted a little bit, like cold butter on toast. Having not really experienced any of those things, I'm hardly qualified to write about them. At least I'm still putting out words. I'm a little bit past 25,000 words, so I'm on track. I got my word count up to 8,733.

I might just have to go for it and finish 50,000 by tomorrow. I made it past the half way mark!! Hoping to seriously catch up on my word count today. you may say I'm stupid, but I'm not the only one.

I'm doing well. I hope this isn't becoming my thing. I think I'll get my word count in late tonight. Still a few thousand behind but I'll get there! Not a great writing day and I don't know if my story has the steam to make it to 50,000 words.

Tonight I must get Guardian up to 25k no matter how late I have to stay up. Not what I was hoping for this late in the month, but when you're a Writer Mama, not much you can do! Trying desperately to stay ahead, since I foresee dark days during Thanksgiving hullabaloo. Closing pinterest because I was justifying my pins as "writing inspiration".

At least I had a bit of a buffer going into this. I had a late start, due to edits on another book. Explaining what rooms look like are very hard for me. Nevertheless I wanna say :

Since I'm writing by hand, my time to stop is usually when my hand starts to hurt and get tired. I've passed the 25K mark, half way! Late but I did it! I never knew what crazy whim I'd have to adapt to next. So I'd planned a 10k day, but due to a migraine I didn't get anywhere near that.

I'm thinking a forced tea party may be in order. Cue Bon Jovi's Livin' on a Prayer' cause I'm half way there! Not that all distractions are bad, or that I haven't enjoyed the distractions of the past two evenings. Today I'm going to try and get those words done before evening, o I won't need to rush through it like last night.

My story isn't done but I hit the minimum! I'm mean it really grinds my fucking gears. Slowly realizing that I'm not even halfway through the plot, though... Might, might write some crap later, but my offspring will make that hard. And I started so well, ahead of the curve, and now, I'm behind.

Need to start to revise so I can feel in the thick of things again. Should do my AM yoga, but my MC still hasn't gotten to kiss her crush yet. I bet I can get at least another 600! I feel like a dumb failure today. I will write today!

my characters are ridiculously complex. Less than 500 words to go until I break 25k! I am now 4000 words behind. Apparently I can write 1000 words in 25 mins when I've got a big target word count to hit.

I wrote 3k this morning but now I'm experiencing some serious focus issues this afternoon. Do you have any words I can use? The pain in my chest makes it impossible to relax enough to write! I just hit 25,018 words.

I am wayyyyyyyyyy behind on nano, but today is for planning. I'm apparently scaring away followers again.

I'm 2,000 words behind. I tried REALLY HARD to stop them! And to show you I mean business : I'm taking a nap. I'm so far behind, but at least I know what I'm writing. It tells me I'm not writing fast enough!

Still nowhere near the actual point of the novel and I can't even begin to explain how unexpected I find this. I can feel my eyes getting very sleepy :( Still behind but at least I reached the 20,000 mark. Hopefully I can step up my game tonight.

I am never missing this again. I'm doing it too and let me tell you IT IS NOT EASY. Er, I mean, what slashfic? :(I will get it back by the end of the night! Going to watch Weeds as a reminder how my life could be so much worse.

I'm not super super far ahead but I'm not behind either. You're running round in circles, calling out my name... Dammit, I'm being mean to my MC again. :(I will get it back by the end of the night! I'd like to put this weekend behind me now.

Welp, seriously think I'm gonna have problems getting to 50K with this story alone... I've written 2.5k but ride isn't here yet. So, I started late (11 days late!) I did it ma!!!!

I did so badly that time, only 295. I won't win, but I'm doing it. Getting closer to my 50k!

I also need some sort of serious plot planning or something.. Now treating myself to a couple of days off, and I'll get back to it after the weekend. Hopelessly behind, but at least I'm going. I'm now at 14k.

Wrote 5,000 more today which means I only have like 15k left to write! I knew I was missing something. I mean month. I mean it! If I make the word goal for today I get to play a video game.

Ugh, so far for the night, i've cleared about 3 thousand words worth of my obstacle. Shit I'm calling it. Going about London I mean? I mean, take months to write novels! I'm really really tired.

I am going to regret this so much in the morning. Not sure if I will use this scene but I am going to finish it because you never know. I'm writing my first Stupid Death Loophole : "Yeah, he got his jaw blown off, but he's a werewolf and the bullet wasn't silver! " "I don't give a flying fuck what it's called if it doesn't exist," Autumn retorted.

Looks like I'll be staying up late to get it done tonight. In lieu of writing, I annotated my Scrivener note cards to figure out the mess I need to revise. Holy fuck I reached par how did I do that? So close I need to make sure I don't go too fast or miss anything big.

Gone past 24K, which means I'm going to go home soon! I even wrote a little unplanned fight scene. I AM SO TIRED but m 1,333 words need to be written. Only 5k more to make my Saturday goal.

It's tough, there have been days where I've been like, "HELL no, no more. 1351 words left to hit the DWC, ahh I know I can get at least half of that if I put my mind to it. I'm 9100 behind with mine. I was just on a site with' funny pictures' in the domain name.

About 4k behind on my nanos. I'm so tired, though. I mean month. but I'm finally getting a chance to at least say... Okay, then...getting my writing mojo back.

OMG just 800 more words until I finally reach 25,000 words!! I know I can catch up but ughhh it's daunting. Still a little behind but I'll get there. It's like CHRISTMAS, I can hardly sleep! I'm falling behind. I'm behind for the 1st time and it's stressing me out.)

I'm going to take a break first. I just missed adding my total in before midnight, so it thinks I'm behind, but I'm not! My 4th but my three no successful. I'm so behind.

I haven't written any more words since the last word count update? I am definitely in the wrong line of work. After the tragic data loss yesterday, I'm finally back up to par! After a break with the family, I have broken 15,000 words.

I'm doing a lot of planning at the mo, behind the scenes stuff. This is why I'm NOT a successful novelist. Today I will try to push past 20,000 words. Just finished a pivotal scene toward the end of my current WIP.

5,600 words behind par, and not sure how I will catch up. Hoping I can stay awake long enough to write tonight. I'm still a couple of thousand words behind schedule. Going to take a break to watch my favorite YouTube stuff, then back at it.

With midnight past, I'm officially 5K behind again. I had a whole folder in Scrivener not being counted! I AM SO BEHIND. I'll need to up my game today. Just not my year and not the right project.

I just wrote like 639 in less than 20 minutes!!! Just gonna keep going' til I drop. I've had 2 : Day 2 got me behind. Because I think that's what I am right now.

Or at least before I'm booted from the table! "...And miles to go before I sleep. I think she's endured enough crap for now. I'll have to SERIOUSLY catch up this weekend, hope everyone else is writing. " I can't decide whether you should live or die.

Secret fact : I write chapter titles before writing the chapter to keep me accountable to my outline. Today I am only a measly 1122 words behind. Didn't write yesterday, glad I hit 20k early!

I'm tired. I'm so behind and tired. I need to get some serious writing done this weekend. As if I was going through the motions. I love my new heroine.

I've just reached my first 50k words! Hoping I can keep it up for the last half of the month. I am officially less than one day behind on my word count! I'm tired. I'm tired and want to go to bed.

Which (for me) is next to impossible. I am super aware of my skeleton right now. Setting aside my football brain for a moment so I can get in some words before the FSU game. Just kidding, I'm giddy as fuck. For someone 15 days late into things, I'm surprisingly ahead of my own schedule.

Let's see if I can manage to scrounge up a quick 2K. still 1K behind but at least I got some writing done. I'm behind in word count but just passed 15000 words.

Not bad, not my goal, but I'll take it. " I say. But at least I'm not 12,000 words behind anymore. Also I'm massively behind on it. Still behind, but I broke 15K.

That might seem behind, but I'm bursty. Be still my racing heart. You can tell I'm getting tired when all I write about is night time, sleep, and dreaming. Not goin 2 b negative, I can do it. I'm ready to write some words.

Which is good, since I likely won't be home from work' til after midnight... Which gets me past the 10k. I am 5,000 words behind. " Maybe I told them to fuck their mothers.

I just finished writing the most intense part of my novel. Send me your word count and your Hogwarts house, so I can award house points! I was sick yesterday so it's double word count Thursday for me today. One of the m.c.'s in my horror novel : "If there's anything worse than being truly alone, it's never truly being alone. I am two units behind in physics.

And now I'm 6k behind... Now I'm going to try to make it to 100k and the end of the story. Oh god I'm behind on wordcount and I'm sitting here writing crappy poetry. But hey, at least I'm writing. I'm ready!

Okay, I have 34,059 words right now and I'm going to hit 35,000 before I go to bed in an hour. I'm not sure. Holy crap I'm actually writing a novel! I am litte tired.




## Chapter 19 ##

Feels like I left my muse out in the cold. As much as I would love to watch more Willow I have to stop and write my own queer witches... I know I'm doing something wrong with this WIP but I CAN'T TELL and it's driving me nuts. This week long detox has been great for my body, but my muse is starving!

Shows how tired I am... I haven't been as stylistically obsessed as usual, but that will come in editing. I really do dig myself into some holes. I wonder how many people have written a script instead of a novel.

I need to write a billion more words tonight (3,000) and all I can think about is my bed. Think I just made some new adventurous, insecure, creative best friends! I think I'm gonna skip out on writing again today but try really hard to kick ass over the weekend. Jeez, and I'm still 5,000 words behind. Me : I'm 13,549 words behind schedule.

My brain is fried and I am so behind and I will catch up. I made it past 25,000 words today. Also my story has become about magic drug dealers.

I seem to get in the zone around 3pm (Writing Zone or Nap Zone, hard to predict!). Haven't been able to reward myself with Sailor Moon Crystal's newest ep so I shall drink and be merry at the wedding tonight. I'm like 10k behind, so I've got some serious making up to do. 32,575 and I'm satisfied with how things are turning out.

At least I managed to save it! I'm tempted to stop just cause that's a cool number. And I'm behind again. 50k (although my file is a mess), a crown, and I'm tired. I like the character more and more.

I've been hard on myself for falling behind, but I wrote over 25,000 words in two weeks, and that deserves a FUCK YEAH GO ME! Ok, so NOW my story is more romance, with a dash of psychological horror. I'm tired. Once I get started, stopping is almost equally as hard. It seems that I'm doing my most productive writing at coffee shops.

Really enjoying my neighbour's drilling. During NaNoWriMo, I'm having more trouble keeping to my normal schedule than ever. Which means I'm behind. I'm behind.

I'm procrastinating because I'm 12,000 words behind... This being true, I've raised procrastination to an art form. Ugh, fell behind because I didn't write for two days. 36890...I can hardly stop now, can I? One more session will see me break through the 50,000 barrier.

I think I'm broken. 30k in and I've changed and moved around so much on my original outline that now it resembles a football play chart. Turns out my characters didn't walk into a trap, but they are walking on thin ice. Not writing for now bc researching a nutso plot bunny that came at me hard. Okay, I'm out for the night.

I've been getting a little behind. Nice to let my brain reboot. I'm still woefully behind, but I now have A Plan. I'm behind but I'm writing and that's all that counts. I just wish the Universe would send some kind of sign...

I'm closer to being caught up, but still a little under 2,000 words behind schedule. I haz broken the 25k word count. 700ish more to go, but I took my migraine meds, so maybe!

HOW AM I 2,000 WORDS BEHIND? I think about 25 of those words are worth reading, but hey! " I've officially fallen behind. Gone past 27K and done writing for the day while I let the tablet charge and rest. Alright, I've got some more writing to do now.

At least I'm trying. I'm going to keep writing at my own pace and feel the story as it progresses. I'm well behind at the moment. Way behind, but I don't even care. I need 500 more words before midnight, in 28 mins!

Let's see if I can get some of the 3k words I'm behind on done as well. I've seen too many people despairing at not hitting word counts. (I am way behind and trying to catch up.) How many can I manage today?

Reached 1,314 on my first 30min sprint :D Time for some word wars! All of my best work is done with it as editing is half the fun! Well, that's a wrap on Day 12 and I've slipped over the 20,000 barrier! (Still 15K behind where I should be...) So, I am a day behind in the story, but two days ahead in word count. I've got one of my characters making jokes during a very tense scene.

I'm at that part of the novel where it just sucks...the writing sucks, the plot sucks, and I suck. Fuck, I'm out of words to write... Writer friend reminds me writing and brain work takes more calories than we realize.Nuts, cheese and protein shakes!

I'm still woefully behind, but I now have A Plan. Afk the vacuum is calling to be fair, the plot easy, because I like his face. Yeah I'm so behind. I'm still 6,000 words behind but making small bits of progress! I have many more words to go today!

I'm kinda tired. I've got a mug full of tea and 7000 words to catch up. Still a little shy of where I need to be in order to be on par for 150k for the month, but I'm now almost there! I'm a little behind but know I can catch up. Tomorrow I'm having a writing retreat for myself, because my own house distracts me sometimes.

I'm a little disappointed in this fact, but I did get a bit of work done. Killed a character off, my poor MC. Only wrote about 700 words today, but I was really excited about those 700! Then 4 more days of 2.5k will put me at the 50k mark!

I am determined to escape this' always 10k behind' thing I have going on. Okay, let's see how close I can get to 2,500 words! Alright, time to patch things up between my MCs and get in some serious wordage! I'm behind. I also think questioning "How good your character is under stress" help reveal alot about them.

I need an answer to "How was your golf game? I'm in love with my story! The big bad villain of my book is about to make his appearance and announce himself to my hero! My word count is closing in on 67,000 but I'm still about 3k behind where I wanted to be. Not doing so good today with my story today.

That sounds like a good day to me. Still behind if I'm going to hit 50k this month. Yeah I was wrong my goal is 45k.

I'm exhausted. Word count isn't where I'd hoped but after being gone most of the day, it's still not bad at all. Broke down the wall standing between me and getting Hattie out of that stupid tree. But at least it's keeping me writing! Let's see if I can get that many tonight!

I'm 3000 words behind and at a rut! WHY did I write all of these broken bones into my story? Only 519 words for yesterday and I find : I'm ok with this. I can't tell if this is a good thing or not.

11:28 pm and I'm absolutely exhausted... Good, I hope. Hearing my wife's stories, and borrowing a name from her day to turn into an illegal chemical supplier. Holy crap, just realized a thing I wrote is totally a metaphor for the character's growth during the scene. (I hope) Let's make it a good one.

Anyone have a good prompt for me? I've passed 25,000 words on my novel, and there was a huge reveal in the plot today. I hate everything about my Nano currently. Too bad I have to drive, or I would be getting slightly (unabashedly) drunk. You know I won't be no perfect Stephen King Clone...so if that's what you're into that go' head and read another tome...

Makes me feel like I'm part of a secret club. Be sure to send me an email if u'd like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K! Also, please tell me I'm not alone when I'm literally writing scenes at random. I'm at 28k, so I had a good 3k day.

I am woefully behind on word count. Okay, so I'm just over 25,000 words at the end of day 15. I'm so sorry. Poor word count day for me today, 763. I need more words!

I'm 6k behind. I think I need to buy more pens! But now I'm 5k wds behind. And I still have tonight to add more!

I am litte tired. I'm writing and it feels so good. Possibly the worst ending sentence I've written in my life, but : draft dance! ending my night of noveling at only 1000 words behind, and no longer am I terribly worried. I am proud that on day 15(halfway), I'm halfway through the word count.

I am ALMOST half way there!!!! Good day for staying warm, listening to music and working on my story. Is it bad that I changed the Game Warden in my novel to a woman because hewasn't very interesting as a man? I guess determining which characters are doomed has been good for my writer's block.

So I don't even feel a little bad about all the reading. Keep squicking myself with the sex scene I'm writing, because I've accidentally made vampire dick kind of gross. i'm done with my novel....i'm about 4000 words shy of 50,000. Oh no, my coffee pot is broken. I bid u all a good journey, but question everything otherwise ur doomed to fallacies set in stone,despite good intentions or not.

Slightly behind schedule, I've broken the 25K mark. If I get to 25k, I'll be happy. Words : 23108 it would appear that I am behind again... I got bored. I may be tired. This makes me happy xD.

WHY DO I WRITE DIFFICULT HEROINES? I'm stuck in the wrong rhyme. I am feeling particularly clever tonight. I'll do a happy dance when I reach it.

And then my muse decided I was wrong. you guys, I'll be winning tomorrow, js. It's my one night to get drunk. I think I'm broken. I just sneezed and laughed like it was the funniest thing.

man I can be twisted. I set my alarm for 5:30 and randomly woke up at four. I apparently write pretty functionally on 5 hours of sleep... Don't think I'll win this year...

It's been a great way to keep my focus up. Now I can write better. 22,000 words and I'm behind. Started today 5000 words behind and now I'm caught up! I even have my fake reading glasses on.

I'm exhausted! Got a lot of catching up to do on my word count. Uncomfortable questions I have for me include : what if I prefer reading to writing. I fell behind yesterday but hey. err, writing buddies, and I wanna win.

I can collapse happy after a 1,900 word session. And now that I've got the world fully set up it's just making all the main action happen. Just realized my novel is bleak, speculative middle grade. My characters have never steered me wrong if I just get out of their way.

Wtf is happening, I can't stop her. It is cold outside, temps in the 20s, I hate it when it's this cold. :) I'm currently working on Snow. My earliest' win' ever, but I'm gonna carry on writing until the month ends.

So I can stop feeling guilty for not participating. I believe it was Bruceman Springsteen who said, "I'm sick of sitting' round here trying to write this book. I think it's great to write romance in it's purest way.

Some great scenes today, even if I dare say so myself. Then I'll write more! I am exhausted, but I'm still going! Also, I think I'm writing the wrong novel. I hate to fail my target so instead of finding a distraction on a hard chapter I plough on.

Picturing Peter Capaldi as the Wizard is dangerous because I keep wanting to close every line of his dialogue with "Fuck off. My wrists are sore, but I am happy. I've got weird priorities. And I hope he lets us win.

I stopped 95 words shy of 24k tonight. my lovely lady WHAT!? But now I am very very tired. Happy to do my part.

I even gave them guilty thoughts about how wrong it was. I've been really uninspired today. Wish I could have hit 2k words, but am happy with the fact that I wrote.

I fail at novel writing. Good thing I have all this coffee. So I'm almost caught up on what little outlining I got done before November started and it's terrifying. (You're welcome, everyone else I'll see today.)

I should be writing but I'm so cold I can't move. I am falling behind! I can't tell you how happy that makes me.

Was really happy about my story unfolding yesterday. I think Ive been reading too many angsty romance novels.. 34,603 and I wonder why it's so difficult to write a scene comprised of girltalk. It never ceases to amaze me when my books take random turns all by themselves. I'm declaring victory for having slogged through that awkward scene, and calling it a night.

I find this fascinating and awesome. And I'm more than halfway in editing Issue 2 of Incendiary. " I was wrong about you. Considering I thought I would fall behind, I just hit the halfway point! I have a crazy idea.

I regret making cake sad. Beer is making me cooperate tonight, lol. Bringing my laptop to a restaurant is my type of "night of writing dangerously. I'm torn between wanting to write and wanting to watch It's Complicated. Also,I am proud that I haven't used "I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding.

I ordered a nano hoodie and feel guilty because nano isn't over. I think this book will be a good bit longer than 50,000, but I am doing great! ' I'm on fucking fire today. And I've just broken halfway! I hope you got good writing done anyway!

I've used it, but I'd be so afraid to lose my work. It's so cold at my computer that I'm about to start typing with gloves on. I'm getting weird looks and lots of questions. Okay, now it's time to get serious, the coffee is kicking in and my fingers are itching to write! I'm SO happy. I'm going to get it while the getting is good!

I'm still behind, but I'm gaining! Saturday is my best shot at catching up. Casually getting a ton of muse for something that isn't my nano novel. If anybody's sprinting this evening, I'd be happy for the motivation.

My word count makes me sad. It's a good word, and it serves my story well! Thinking tomato soup for my unhappy throat. There's chocolate on my keyboard and mania in the ballroom.Must be the Night of Writing Dangerously. Good work, me!

30K and insanely stoked, I think I caught my second wind of ideas! I need a good night of rest so I can write some tomorrow before the boy I watch arrives! Unfortunately, I need to go to bed now. Been trudging my way through this and haven't even gotten to the truly awkward scene yet. To any NSA agents who might be monitoring me : My recent disturbing search history is just research for my novel, I swear. I'm feeling good!

I'm declaring victory for having slogged through that awkward scene, and calling it a night. I am going to hit 30k words before the weekend is out because I am a fucking boss. Thanks to that monster 30 minute sprint I'm over halfway to 50k! my brilliant plan to wake up at 7:00 and write 770 words before work ended with me getting up at 8:07 and writing 170.

It's a good thing I'm sitting at 34K! I feel like I should win a prize. If I feel like what I'm writing is ridiculous and stupid, I remind myself that they put a dance off in Guardians of the Galaxy. Everyone's talking about The Night of Writing Dangerously and I'm just. Im behind in my word count and I think I might hate everything I've written.

I'm totally brilliant until I start writing. The good news is I have a sore throat, killer toothache, and no idea what to write. This book has a lot of awkward moments with characters' mothers, I just realized. I write so haphazardly that sometimes I lose the sequence of my novel. What is wrong with me?!




## Chapter 20 ##

I have this awesome story, but it's covered up by a mudslide of crappy words. Good thing I have the day off! I have an hour then I gotta record the listening test. I am writing a novel in 30 days, It's crazy but attainable. Thinking tomato soup for my unhappy throat.

Whatever you do, I'm proud of you!! I had my mandatory coffee and might get another, lol. Anyone else just writing without a plan or am I crazy? but I hate to get behind.

I've written nearly a thousand words so far today. It would be incredible if I could do it. 1am is a really awkward time to get inspiration, but I'm taking it where I can get it. If I can get it to 85k by the end of the month, I win!

This is so difficult omg whyyyyyy am I doing this agaaaiiinnnnn?!... Can't sleep bc I have a cold. I'm hoping to hit at least 31,666 to be two solid days ahead of schedule. It's upbeat, beautiful and perfect for my mood. Doing my best to catch up!

If I don't make it to 30K tomorrow, I'm going to be very angry with myself. I hit 23k but accidentally stumbled into a awkward, accidental flirting scene which I'm always terrified to write so... I had to go to the hospital everyday for a week. 700 words ahead of where I planned to be, that's what I call a successful night! I think "Et voila, instabffls" is probably one of the best things I've ever written in a character bio.

I'm so bad at multitasking. This cold is messing with my head. She took out her good boobs and let me tell you something : they were real good. Awesome writing day and I'm not even done.

I wanted 1k so badly, but just didn't have it in me that sprint. Didn't get a lot of writing done this weekend, but I am still 5000 words ahead and planning on writing like crazy tomorrow. I don't want to get behind! Even if it's not my best work, I'm building a good habit! That was an awesome sprint for me.

I will now start writing like crazy to try and get 6K so I'm at 110K before tomorrow. Be awesome if I could crack 20,000 words. And that's not even counting the 3516 words of random fanfic I've written today! Some of my best ideas come while driving...

I will take that as an awesome start to my day! I'm literally still screaming with happiness! I'm cold, so I crawled under the covers to write. I've been in a bad mood ever since. Note to myself in my manuscript : "insert bad word here.

Cold mornings I still sit on my front porch, writing. That's how I get my best stuff. Too bad, I was on a roll. Nano is bad for my tweeting habits. So I came up with The Best Plan to deal with my inappropriate issues.

I've got it bad. I wish I hadn't sucked so bad yesterday, though. Because I hate you the least. 5,000 more word to go until I hit my word count goal!!! I've discovered after some trial and error, i seem to do my best writing between 10pm and 3am.

I am honestly shocked I'm still on track... Why does the perfect sentence come to me the moment after I put shampoo in my hair?

Too bad I have to work two jobs tomorrow so I may not get to write. It's like I'm perfect par for day 10!!!... I've never had writers block this badly before. I'm participating as a' cheater' and proud of it!

I guess not too bad to start with. I wanted to do it in 14 days, but 16 days is still impressive. Despite all my fears and doubts, this is going not too badly. If you need to kill a character, I have the perfect murder : eat roasted garlic hummus and breathe on them.

Still a bit behind, but I'll catch up tonight!! Cheering for my awesome antagonist. I was too sick to write... We've surpassed the halfway mark and I'm shocked that I still have something to say. This is the best set up I've ever written.

" "I'm a failure, my ideas suck, I hate my life!! :D Nichelle_Rae is my site profile! I think I made myself sick. I just opened my novel after two days "sick leave. hit 20,000 words and I'm feelin awesome, think that i should make writing my career!

Knew this month would be crazy and I'd probably fail but this is pathetic. I got some great writing done yesterday. And that's my lead :( So I have this really bad habit of not, reaching word counts. The best advice I've found is to ignore all advice.

You must think me mad! I was so disappointed. Reply with any random idea and I will try to incorporate it! I was doing great on my 2K per day goal, and now I've got nothing... I think Reanne is my favorite charecter EVER!!!!!

Stupid flu symptoms making my head stuffy. After a refuel of roast chicken and rice, I made my today's target of 40,000 words! I am honestly shocked I'm still on track... I make good decisions! " This is us at our best and I wish it could always be like this.

Shall try my best to get there. If there was a National Email Writing Month, I'd be fucking OWNING it... :(However, I'm crazy close to 22K! I'm literally yelling at my characters for being stupid. I hate when I come to a spot in writing where I'm blocked on what happens in one paragraph, but not for page upon page after it.

I hate flashbacks. Aaargh, I'm a mere 350 words away from 25,000!! Wow, you guys are tweeting me with some high numbers. And I just came up with an awesome title for a tattooists.

WHY OH WHY AM I BEHIND!!! I'm really proud of all the progress! Procrastination how do I hate thee? I hate writers block. Not having the greatest day, but I broke 20k!

Crap I'm stuck... " Despite my best efforts to suppress them, the words lay just below the surface, I hate you. This has been my best day yet.

I am beginning to find myself exceedingly annoying. What I hate : my followers leave to support the editing. 1745 words tonight...I could keep going, but I fear I am working on fighting being sick and my bed calls. I know I'm gonna win this!

I'd tell you about it, but I don't want you to hate me, fellow NaNoWriMoers. The best thing about writing a novel is that I can write whatever I want. I hate that I need to go to bed. Currenty sitting at 25,073 words and I am happy!

It is a challenge, but I am pushing along with the support of my wonderful wife. But my characters are definitely stupid. I'm bloody insane. After I'm boring and go to work, that is.

I don't know if I can sleep, I'm so excited!!!!! And I don't think it's all crap. It feels like a never ending wasteland :(I can't wait to be in the 30ks! I am a pathetic lump.

It hates me and I hate it. I'm so happy I could cry! Despite feeling horrible and dealing with a headache, I got my writing done today. I wrote 1,352 words in 30 min this morning, which is the best I've ever done!

On my way to San Francisco for Night Of Writing Dangerously!!!!! Week two slump :(I feel like stopping! I've been too sick to write. Even if I don't reach wordcount today, thats still awesome.

I feel terrible. I think I write best in sprints. I'm at that point in writing a novel where you just think it's terrible and want to give up. I'm proud!

Horrible confession of the day : Sometimes I purposely leave compounds unhyphenated... I'm going to do terrible things to you. I'm going to do terrible things to you. The worst thing is that I can write whatever I want. That was an awesome sprint for me.

Writing my character's recuperation is boring. Ttown is insane so I am in you today! That was an awesome sprint for me. Lol I'm also at 32k words so close to finishing!

I need to figure out the worst thing my FMC's ever done (not murder). I just realized a horrible event I'd planned is about to happen to my MC and I feel so horrible about it. The word counting is driving me insane! I'm so proud of everyone!

I've showered, done dishes, and consumed three fucking delicious tacos. I am an evil, evil man. Writing tip : Often as I type, I know it's terrible but I won't interrupt the stream. Hit twenty thousand words and I'm feeling awesome!
