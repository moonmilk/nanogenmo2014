# You Can't Write If You Can't Relate #

## Chapter 1 ##

I've been having trouble writing for 3 days now. Let myself get intimidated looking at the single page of research I did last month. Still short of where I need to be but the night isn't over yet. I should have made it, may not January. As my antagonist's arc gets more and more convoluted and cruel, I want to write his prospective less and less. I am definitely in the wrong line of work. It never ceases to amaze me when my books take random turns all by themselves. Ttown is insane so I am in you today! " "I'm a failure, my ideas suck, I hate my life!! Today I am only a measly 1122 words behind. I can't exactly stop NOW, can I? That's gonna set my progress back. On migraine day 3 and I smell like an apothecary.

I wrote absolutely nothing today, but I feel like my cold has gone away. I'm in a shame spiral with my writing today. I think that's enough... My problem with NaNoWriMo is I always get a million other book ideas and have to write them at the same time. At least I was caught up for about 24 hours. I'd tell you about it, but I don't want you to hate me, fellow NaNoWriMoers. Still a bit behind, but I'll catch up tonight!! Too lazy to transfer it to my computer tonight. Took me long enough, even with only one hand. I lied.

Can I add all the tweets I've written in November to my word count? I've been waiting for this since I started writing. I did it ma!!!! I'm beginning to use "My hair needs to be done" as an excuse to not write. " I'm not really talking about you, am me ". At least I'm back on the horse. While ideas flood through, I'm oddly at peace. I knew I was missing something. Just blew past my halfway point, and the momentum grows. I am a mean, mean, mean writer person. Shows how tired I am... Still a little shy of where I need to be in order to be on par for 150k for the month, but I'm now almost there! This cold is messing with my head. I'm at that point in writing a novel where you just think it's terrible and want to give up.

I'm going to do terrible things to you. Also, I think I'm writing the wrong novel. Just kidding, I'm giddy as fuck. Hopefully I'll hit 1k if not more! I'm not sure. I am currently at a little over 15k. only about 500 words today, which is not enough but at least it gets me past 24k. My previous novel was at a dead end, so I decided to start a new one. Just passed 37k and I'm steadily getting plugged back into my novel after a few days without writing. I am stuck in the doldrums. But a break for now I think.

Now I'm only 5,000 words behind! I went from being over 5K words behind last week to over a day ahead today. I've lost my mojo when my character went down a hill. I beat it up and left it for dead in a ditch. Would write more but : a) need to go to bed, b) my characters are being awkward and untalkative. I pledge my word! Let's see if I can bang out another 1500. I'm literally yelling at my characters for being stupid. It is cold outside, temps in the 20s, I hate it when it's this cold. Not a great writing day and I don't know if my story has the steam to make it to 50,000 words. " The words I was thinking of weren't nearly so kind. I just missed adding my total in before midnight, so it thinks I'm behind, but I'm not! Starting my writing at 10:30 pm : not a good idea. It's 14 minutes past my bedtime and I'm just starting writing for today. I'm consistently a day behind. I have discovered the secret to nighttime writing : SUPER LOUD METAL THAT WON'T LET YOU GET SLEEPY. How many times can I spell my heroine's name wrong?

In lieu of writing, I annotated my Scrivener note cards to figure out the mess I need to revise. So apparently, after having no job for a month and a half I am now too busy for everything. I'm on a roll! I'm have no discipline. I'm not convinced. I will write during my down time at work and when I get home. Hopelessly behind, but at least I'm going. Too bad I have to work two jobs tomorrow so I may not get to write. The worst thing is that I can write whatever I want. Just realized my novel is bleak, speculative middle grade. Last 1K I wrote, however, is deeply weird. That was me jumping up and down as I figured out my next plot twist. I had to make up for falling short yesterday. I need some adderall.

Whom has set this next book I'm writing INSIDE that home! Today I'm going to put a dent in the word count. I will rise up. I'm still not sure what he's going to do, I shall learn much about him. Life interfered the last few days but I am back on track with writing my novel. I am a LOT of words behind and am now considering changing my main idea. I do mean things to fictional people. Passed 20.000 words, but I am behind of my personal goal of 25k. Last 1K I wrote, however, is deeply weird. So looking back at my life choices, november was the worst possible time to get completely obsessed with Teen Wolf. I'm behind. I'm tired. I am going to hit 30k words before the weekend is out because I am a fucking boss. I need to figure out the worst thing my FMC's ever done (not murder).

Writing my character's recuperation is boring. I think I'm broken. I have a really hard time accepting that rubber band is two words. Nearly half way, but my novel still makes no sense. but then I didn't write a single word yesterday... I feel torn between trying to get another 1000 or going out to have beer and scotch. Nevertheless I wanna say :

Despite feeling horrible and dealing with a headache, I got my writing done today. I am writing a novel in 30 days, It's crazy but attainable. Alright, time to patch things up between my MCs and get in some serious wordage! I've had 2 : Day 2 got me behind. I'll have to SERIOUSLY catch up this weekend, hope everyone else is writing. 1 a.m., secretly writing a novel in the dark, under covers, on my iPhone. Hate how my chart bars stay right on that line! I am posting no more pictures through this weekend instead I'm going to go be productive with other things. I'm so tired, woke up so early, but I have... I should be writing but I'm in sugar coma. My current wordcount is 22222 and this is extremely pleasing to me. my story is actually 74569 words long now. I think it helped me find out about Marcie and her mother. Still writing by the seat of my pants. Trying to find my mojo. I think that's a record for me.

I'm not really sure why. At 16591 words, I have clawed my way back to only 5000 words behind schedule! The character that I spent a lot of time building up just died, and her fiance is about to find out. not my usual writing, but a pretty good base going on. I'm having issues with a char's development, so I'm putting together a playlist based on what I think his tastes are. Write for 30 minutes, meet me back here! I'm cold, so I crawled under the covers to write. I am litte tired. I never knew what crazy whim I'd have to adapt to next. Only 10K words so I'm behind schedule. I'm over 17k but feel so far behind. Alright...2 down...going to get a few more words into 3 and then maybe I can slow the pace down a little bit. I'm not a competitive person, but give me 30 days to write 50k, and a list of opponents... I need a variation of Tellervo.

I just wrote 2,000 words in a half an hour. I've stopped. I hope so. Did I lose the spark? I have 8000 words to write just to get back on track. " I've only read 4 books this month, "cries the girl who usually reads a book a day. I am officially less than one day behind on my word count! Reply with any random idea and I will try to incorporate it! I am a pathetic lump. Too bad I have to drive, or I would be getting slightly (unabashedly) drunk. This whole writing every day thing is ruhl bad for my fingers. It's going to take more than cold fingers to stop me. All done cleaning the bathroom, and now I'm gonna show my novel who's boss. i've destroyed my plot by trying to outline it and fill in the holes.

Why did I do this to myself? I just might make it halfway today. I've just counted what I wrote during a day. Do I have to block him again? I feel super behind, but I need 2273 words a day to finish on time. Starting to have a little faith that I'm going to get those 50,000 written. I'm at the halfway point for the average Wrimo. It's dark, rainy, cozy, writey weather and I'm pounding the hell out of this book. I thought I was going to slow down after reaching 50K yesterday. Tonight I must get Guardian up to 25k no matter how late I have to stay up. :(I will get it back by the end of the night! I'll need to up my game today. If I feel like what I'm writing is ridiculous and stupid, I remind myself that they put a dance off in Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm going to do terrible things to you.

...that I am here for him if he ever just can't take the silence anymore... I should be on track to hit halfway by Sunday. What do I write? She sounds like my daughter. I'll be sprinting tomorrow if you're around. I think my brain is destroyed by too much writing lately. The words are rolling, 733 words so far, but I am so far behind! 1778 in on the manuscript, 0 in on the 2 papers I have due tomorrow night. Procrastinated for half the day and now I'm about halfway through today's goal. It's not a month of novelling madness if I don't break out the Atonement soundtrack for a few days of writing. RS : Although next year, I'm going to prepare a random jar of motivational snippets to keep me going. I stepped away for no more than two minutes and I've lost 800 words what the fudge! One of the m.c.'s in my horror novel : "If there's anything worse than being truly alone, it's never truly being alone. I'm tired. 1am is a really awkward time to get inspiration, but I'm taking it where I can get it. Writing tip : Often as I type, I know it's terrible but I won't interrupt the stream.

After I'm boring and go to work, that is. Wtf is happening, I can't stop her. Poor word count day for me today, 763. I'm a little over 900 away from 30k!! Let's see if I can get Lars the cat into some trouble today. I'm not that far behind thankfully. I'm a couple of days behind and could really use some motivation at the moment! So with tears in my eyes and Blackbird in my head I'm going to write. Passed 20K in my manuscript! I think my hand is going to fall off. Wish me luck!




## Chapter 2 ##

I can make that up. I have the energy of a dishrag soaked in Valium. Yup only four short scenes to write and I'll be finished with plot. I want the boy gone. And I did it! Now it's time for sleep before my brain turns to jelly. I'm freezing. So I pull over to the side of the road and I heard "Son do you know why I criticized your novel for? but I did manage 400 words on the way into work! I think that's a record for me. I literally vant mm not tuopst. But the words amuse me! I can't find it anywhere.

Write for 30 minutes, meet me back here! finally, a sentence describing my plot that makes sense. I wish I was a discovery writer. I needed a night away from writing over 2k. I think. I am FLYING through this novel! The tension is killing me. So I gotta catch up tomorrow! I'm gonna try for 5,000 words today. I find it easier to write about murder than to describe my MC's living room.

I advise to write short articles. I'm getting Internal Server Error messages when I try tweeting. Gotta sit until my word count gets back on track. BUT HOW ELSE CAN I WRITE??? I'm not finished either! I hit my word count goal yesterday, and I'm on my way today. I have finally crossed the 35,000 word threshold.

Maybe I should start killing characters. If someone said I'd still be doing this 2 weeks in, I'd ask "why would you say something like that? I have done this. Let's see if I can hit 2k! After one hour of constant writing, I feel like my word count is actually going backwards. Today I am shooting for 20k words. I worked on my book today. I think that's a record for me. I feel like I'm not gonna finish in time. People in my hall need to stop slamming doors. On track to break my goal of 100,000 words this month. How do I word? I've got this. I'm hitting my stride as I approach 30,000 words, but could use a foot rub and a calf massage. I still have a lot of story left to write. I've written over 20,000 words. For every 1k words I write, I seem to be gaining a lb in weight!

Realizing at 16,000 words in that I have to rework my entire outline? I WISH I could remember how I imagined this conversation this morning. We'll see if I can do it!

Sometimes I think she is a lot like me, then she does something like this..

I' ma go do the thing. I' m... I will not cry. I just booked a dental appt for 7AM SATURDAY. I've lost my writing momentum. I've already won over 5K words, plus I'm honing my writing discipline.

## Chapter 7 ##

I'll check it out. The one I started in November 2012 but still! I can do this!!! Listening to Jeff Buckley as I write. Been nesting at my desk. Let my characters share my misery. Looking at what I'm going to write today and lulzing at myself. Come join me! No clue what I'm doing next. I went from, "I don't want to write tonight," to "I wrote 2,400 words. I might just reach that today! Finally decided what I want for Christmas. Let's add on to my word count at 20 after 4 in the morning. Literally writing in my sleep. I've had a couple of 2k days and I'm almost caught up!

I don't think I'll get done with this in time but I'm gonna have to try. So I'm going to settle for anything. I don't fee like writing today. If one word could change your life forever, I know what it would be. I hope everyone has a productive day! I'm not doing anything but writing today! Only wrote 800 words today, and it's all history, not story, but I think I've rerailed the train before it could crash. Now if my mutinous Trigeminal nerve will let me. OMG writing this tiny, jewish mambo from queens is killing me! Rereading bits of my story for inspiration. I'm sitting so low in my chair that I'm using a travel pillow. I'll take it. Wonder if I can knock out 3K to break 30K? I've had a cocktail, you see.

I think I'll call it a night. I feel torn between trying to get another 1000 or going out to have beer and scotch. The end is coming up on me faster than I'd like. But I must resist... I am killing week 2! I knew the Wizard would get me going! Reading the internet is not helping me get story written. " Am I in danger? Now I gonna go collapse... I'd like to have a 10k weekend. What if I'm just a rock?...I'm going to try anyway. If I can manage just over 5k words today I will finally be caught up on my word count. But I still do it. I might actually make it with this novel! I've hit the halfway mark! Yeah my mama she told me don't worry about your edits... I talked to myself in the novel to end it out. Got my 1,738 I was looking for. I was SUPPOSED to split this big chunk between yesterday and today...

I managed to catch up! I need 8,000 words to catch up today. I have finally figured out the conflict of my novel! Going to get some writing in as I wait for stuff. or I guess their body count? Finally broke 10K on my novel this month! I'm off to bed. I wrote 6898 words today. For the 1st time since Nov 1, I did NOT write yesterday. almost halfway to my goal of 30,000 with 14,886 words... No power in the verse can stop me, except running out of tea. I have a novel to write!! I'm trying to figure it out. And yes, I feel just as itchy about that one extra word as you imagine. If I type nonstop? I didn't know it was going to get this deep.

Now just one problem : How to shut my mind up while I have to work or sleep? Let's see if I can hit the halfway mark today! I'm going to need chocolate. I wrote 2500 words today. " the giant announced, handing me a broomstick. I'm still at 20k. Things I did yesterday : Hit the 25,000 word mark! I should be close to the middle of my story. I need some cheerleaders! Do I sleep or do I write? I wish my tweets counted toward my word count. Something in my fridge was growing mold so I wrote a short story about it.

I'm going to need a beta reader like it's going out of style. I could get a lot done in 2.5 hours. Alright muse, I'm gonna need you to cooperate. " "Nothing, my dear Frodo. As if I was going through the motions. Got a lot going on today, but still managed to bump my word count to 10,563. At this rate, I'll be done in six days. Away from me, ye stouthearted, that are on... You never glare at me anymore. But I might make it anyway. I do not like novel writing on my phone. 16,000 words on my project. But my characters need me. I make that a promise to myself! Literally every time someone walks into my room while I'm writing, I lost my train of thought.

(I like choosing who to write about). Ending my procrastination. just have to keep reminding myself why I started. p.s. oh yes I'll be counting those excised words, don't think I'm not. The career author beat me. puts me at 2K for the day. I would like to blame it on the bossa nova, but I do need to write. I am DOING it. Teen because I write crappy like one. But I am using November to start my second novel, codenamed "The Forest of Eternal Youth" I only have to write 200 words at a time. You don't understand it, how can I explain? I'm a writer, just keep on writing! But I'm writing. I'm gonna make 1k yet! I know it's a slog but keep at it. I think my hand is going to fall off. Maybe I'll start a nrw story.

Heading back to the crawl I abandoned last night. I've hit a wall. I'm at the turn in the story. Mom and dad are ushering me to log off. Oh hey, I just passed 25,000 words on my second book! The word "chortled" sticks out like a sore thumb to me. I'm close to 5,000 words. The 1K words I wrote yesterday, might be the biggest breakthrough I've had in over a year. Well, I have given myself quite some pickles to sort out in this story. I guess I'll get some morning words in. Needed to name a place in my WIP. and we'll see where I can go from there. and i think that's all i have in me today. I've nicknamed my two MMCs asshole and sasshole.

Today I managed 2509. I woke up today with an urge to lie in bed all day and write. I just don't have the time to write. This has not been my month.

Yes, but now I have a reason to wake up tomorrow. My eyes are getting fuzzy, so I'm going to call it a night... Was planning on writing during M's nap but my sinuses just imploded. I am a masochist. The emotion returned, and guided me. I hope this is not a harbinger for today's word count. I have lost my damn mind. I wrote over 4k words today. And my brain. I lied. " I equate writing it with "vomiting. Maybe I'll try this approach again tomorrow! I'm at 28k. Wish me luck! This is my last sprint with you guys, so let's make all the words count! Looks like I have double writing to do today.

Had to meet my word quota for today and I did. I'm out! Don't stop me Smee. I'm so sleepy. I hope so. I say "the end". If I continue to make up words I could probably get to 30k today.

Above and beyond my personal goal : just hit 25.1k! Can I do it? I need 6000 words to catch up to tomorrow's pace. I'm clearing the decks.

Twitter is still a bit of a mystery to me. Everything I try to do... 45k, I am totally in you. I've totally lost my marbles in the last five minutes or so. can the rest of my life stop now so i can finish this...? Hell, maybe I can finish all 50k this weekend. Which is why I'm trolling twitter now. I'll take it. It's a 5k Weekend and I'm almost done. I'm worn out from hiking. I feel stuck on this chapter! The plot thickens as my brain mushens. I have a character who just used the word "poppycock" in a sentence. I might not get to 50000 by Dec, but if I can manage double figures by the end of tonight that'll be something... I type it out and say... I wanna see tons of wordies. What have I done?!




## Chapter 8 ##

Who wants to write my novel for me??? Slightly below my goal, but that just about 3 times as many words as yesterday! I was just on a site with' funny pictures' in the domain name.

Does it count as a sex scene if my character is getting off on murdering a room full of murder fetishists? I know I'm often not sure while writing, but this time, it feels more so. I notice I can focus more when I have the tv on in the background, no sound. I'd like to hear some interesting things that get other writers motivated. Bit much for my series for what to call "kitten" anymore. I'm embarrassed to have so much real life in my novel. " Well, my love, now you'll taste the privileges of being a White!

Still about 3500 words behind but if I can hit 19K tonight I will feel a little better. I need to stop drinking coffee at night. I KNEW I SHOULD'VE STOPPED EDITING! The emotion returned, and guided me. Hopefully I can finish by this weekend! Yes, I'm hearing that the Fortress of 25k has crumbled! Listening to my daughter play clarinet and procrastinating. " I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days. I'm going to close my eyes and count to five. Now I can breathe. Then I can do all the reading and Lego LOTRing I want! Yes, yes I would.) I just signed on and saw this! ...but it's the same place every time, my bed!

I do. Pausing in my current crawl to eat lunch. Open question to my follow writers : What would a date with a imaginary friend be like. Using coldturkey to ensure that I get writing done. I saw this happened to someone else last week. I'm at 29,000 words now! A small victory but only the beginning of my writing journey today! If I had written one word fewer, I would be 11111 words behind right now. Just got the idea for a revision "to do" spreadsheet for things I know I want to revise after November. skipping a scene that I probably shouldn't. Running a spell check so I can see the grade level at the end? I'm on a roll! All that being said, I'm still striving for 50,000 words by Nov. I wanted to go to bed but ended up writing.

In case anyone was wondering : Sir Bedivere is my dude. Am I at the halfway point in my novel? Also, I reached the end of what I'd actually plotted out before hand. Can I push through to 2,000 words tonight?! Today I tried a chapter in 1st person. Think I'll make that my target and then get some rest. I'm ahead and I want to stay ahead and have ALL the words. That'll work for my universe... I wasn't feeling well the last few days so I took some time off from writing to sleep (like a jerk) but I'm back in action. How long can I drag on a conversation between two minor characters? Okay, weekend of the Night of Writing Dangerously, here I come! I mean they are fictional, after all.

I meant 5,747! I got this! I hit 7k tonight! I think I can, I think I can, I think I can. help me. I can't force any words to come out... Just me? I wish life were like a MMORPG. I'm thinking it's a swimming break time and then back to hit that 37k or possibly 38k. I am doing this. I've written 750 words, so it's not a complete loss. I must have gotten enough sleep,' cause my brain is fleshing out subplots and characters faster than I can get it all down! I didn't count the time' cause I was doing other stuff too, like eating breakfast. I haven't had a single green day yet!

But I'm going to, because I'm a fucking professional. Slowly but surely I'm getting there. Because I can barely keep up this year. I was 2500 words ahead of my daily goal since day 7 and today I have barely reached it. Because I cut myself and had to bleed. By tonight, I will have written 25,000 words.

I hope the second half goes as smoothly. Sometimes I am so stoked about this story and others I am completely bummed about it. We have a love hate relationship and right now, I love you.

I don't know why, but every word feels like a struggle tonight. I love the Queen's willow tree, it has such a whimsical feel to it, she serves her tea beneath the willow tree, nearly always. Sometimes I feel like the only thing I'm good at is pushing through on difficult writing days. I'm at work, smiling and feel alive. I find it funny and quite amusing how songs just randomly pop into my head while writing. So, I'm pretty sure I've got you beat in the slow department. Only 1,205 words written today (though it's better than 0), putting me at a total of 26,255. I am writing so much every day that the November dates seem to creep forward.

I have one almost complete shirt and one almost complete pencil skirt. I keep on reminding myself that this is only the first draft. But that doesn't mean I'm going to give up.

So there is a large surreal moon in my story. I think i took on too much this month. I need a few writing prompts, if anyone would be so kind...

I lost the tiara. This is me vowing to hit the 25k word point by midnight. Maybe I'm inspired to add a few more... After 2 pm my brain is pretty much like writing? Every time I write a scene where a couple I ship fights or breaks up I get kind of emotional. YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I DIDI! 14,635 total words, and I think it is safe to say that this writing night has been beyond successful. Just take my money. she's so big that she crashed my work computer... Remember those 47 words I was expanding yesterday? I wrote 3638 words in an hour...

Well now that the big wurm has attacked, I need a cool way for our heroes to defeat it... I love the word "suddenly. I am seriously having the best day of writing since day 1.

I'm excited to be sooo close to the end! " Justice for Katie "is going well, word count is at 32K and I'm more excited the more I write. 500 more words and I will allow myself to go buy some new Magic cards. Just thought I'd hit my first 1,000 words for the day. I don't know. Making it to 40k is my goal for tonight. Looking like I will take the rest of the week to catch up. To Do list : 1) Everything that has been distracting me from writing. I always had a "rush" problem in my writing. 30K is begging for me to make it. Today my characters are captured and brought to a camp who's leader is a dictator of sorts. I am feeling particularly clever tonight. First one I've liked this much since I published Jute. Mostly' focused' free writing, for me. Guess I'd better get a couple hundred words in before bed.

Not of writing, just tired and wish I had more time. Keep squicking myself with the sex scene I'm writing, because I've accidentally made vampire dick kind of gross. MC on a great adventure right now and all I can think is how much I want to travel his route. Going to write many words this weekend to catch up to my goal. Been a great day so far, managed to reach all my goals up to this point! Why can't I go back to my first year of NaNo where I was happy writing 4k on cleaning the house just to make up words? Well, so far I've done 1,869 words and I've got to stop to get ready for work. Today I wrote 2620 words and have a total of 24,785. I contemplate giving up. Holy shnikes, an even 43k in my master file. I have! Now I have purpose. I've written some words. Tummy is full of sushi, I'm back in my pjs, let's finish this fight scene from earlier this morning. Good thing I don't have a class' til ten. I have more, but pacing is important. These characters love to talk and will not let me stop writing.

Dear Monsanch, Whhy in my head do you look like Viggo Mortensen in Eastern Promises? To catch up to the 25,000 mark, I need 10,042 words. Wrote another 3.5k for my new novel yesterday. I am starting to love what I am writing, but unearthing all this is making me crave talk therapy...or whiskey. During that paragraph I get the most intense ice pick head ache I've gotten in weeks. I'll be fine. I need to write more. BTW, I'm at 21,285 words. I wish I could just sit in the library all day and write... Countdown to thanksgiving break means thinking about how to get my wordcount to 50,000. I feel torn between trying to get another 1000 or going out to have beer and scotch.

I've had a pretty good writing day considering all the stuff I've been doing today. finally starting to love writing my novel, after 21 thousand words, hooray! I just hit 15,000 a bit ago... I can make that up, though, yes? I write what I want and edit later. I wrote over 1,600 words yesterday, bringing my total to 45,690. I don't think I'll reach 50k. I hope it works. Now I must go get lunch. Back on track now :) and getting more into my comfort zone. I need 875 more words to have 5k for the day... I love this time of year.

Already hit my word count for the day, but I'm on a roll. Writing in the kitchen is my new favorite thing. And more to write before I sleep. Let my fingers overcome my creative lapses. Now I'm even more excited myself! Didn't write yesterday, glad I hit 20k early! Time to procrastinate, all the while complaining about how I didn't "have enough time" for this. I have somehow managed to keep up with my word count though. I just wrote : Someone who cared but knew well enough when enough was enough. I hope it stresses the reader. Wish me luck! Do you think I can do it? I need another brain. Sweet mother of Celestia, I can't believe I did it. A Noveltini and witty banter await me... How many words can I write today?

" I can take this with me. I think about 25 of those words are worth reading, but hey! I need more time and energy. Okay, I'm making you guys a promise. I'm not super happy with the story, will take a lot of editing, but I'm continuing to write! Barrelling along to complete todays 5k challenge and to reach my personal goal of 25K words before tomorrow. I predict severe overcaffeination today. I'm so far behind on my word count, it's not even funny. Last year on day 14 I did 9500 in a single night. I have needs too! I have a lot of sprinting to do. I complain too much! I love the voice of your site. " I'm too lovesick for love stories "




## Chapter 13 ##

I'm the one who'd be dead by now if looks could kill. I'm 4,339 words behind par and I only have an half an hour of time I can spend writing today. And now I'm officially half way. i have written half of my 50K words... My weeks wear me down. 6,578 words behind today's total quota, but I've almost met the 1,667 word daily quota. I had an idea for the next chapter of my story but then realized it wouldn't fit in with the timeline. This one's so very different than all of my previous NaNo Novels. I went back to add a little to a chapter..and it became a whole new dramatic twist I wasn't even expecting. Right, I will play ONE game of Heroes of the Storm, and then back to writing! I've hit 22k, ready for day 14 and a weekend of planning the next half of the book! I just passed the 25000 mark!!! I can't even deal, guys. I just can't. Just wrote the scene that inspired my WIP while listening to the song that inspired my WIP. So I know what to do with Luke.

Almost half way there and I finally figured out how to put the scifi in my scifi novel. I wrote 1300 words on my phone. Ending tonight with 28.2k words, so close to 30k that I can almost taste it. Anybody want to sprint with me at : 30 for 25 minutes? But today I feel like I'm slogging. Had to meet my word quota for today and I did. I've been very busy last few days, but now I am back! Princess heads out to avoid my stalker, there wasn't really a tonight thing. I've hit my half way point. I am not a total failure, damnit! Did I miss a few days? I wrote so few words, I didn't even add them up and add it to my word count. A little later than usual, but I did it! The words won't show up if I'm doing other things. Sorry I have to stop my 15 minute word sprints to eat a candy cane it's important. Just passed the 35000 word mark on my novel in progress. 1,800 words tonight and I'm calling it quits. Gonna go kill all my characters off, bye.

I know I'm a day behind, but I finally broke 20k! Wordcount goes up steadily, but I'm always stuck 7k behind no matter how hard I write! With a little luck and some diligence at the keyboard, I should finish the WIP tomorrow night. Of course I have writers block, of freaking course, less than 3,000 words from the minimum and I can't think. I feel like he's staring everyone down. but I'm finally getting a chance to at least say... Im behind been busy so back to work I go! I have a few extra scenes and a minor subplot I can do for padding, so hopefully that helps. Not really worried about my overall word count.

Still pretty behind on my word count at 20k, but I think I'll pull ahead now. I couldn't concentrate on writing so I thought COFFEE but now I think it was because I was already too hyper... Tomorrow I want to work on my SEKRIT PROJECT, though. Think I'll choose drawing. I'm going to write like a maniac tonight. I've crossed the finish like yesterday. I need alcohol. In any case, I am almost done what will probably be the longest story in the collection. Hoping I can keep it up for the last half of the month. I need to put down 2,000 words today and I am a bit stuck. Thank you word sprints, my random writing (all over the place but still in plot) brings me to 20,353 words so far! Seeing a few Tweets pass my way on it. Day 14 and I'm over half way! You're running round in circles, calling out my name... This brings me to a little over halfway to my goal for today. I think tomorrow I'll start off by reading The Slow Regard Of Silent Things. Much too exhausted now to make up the 1k difference in drafts, but I'll write extra tomorrow. I just put my headphones on so I wouldn't disturb the cat. Don't tell me if it's the last one, I'm a giant baby. I took two days off so have pretty much put myself behind where I wanted to be. Why do I let myself get so far behing?

Dragged 2222 words out from the dark recesses of my subconscious and nailed them into word. Day 14 Starting to feel like I've hit a rut. I never had "Siri" before on my old phone!

I'm so far behind, but at least I know what I'm writing. I've been handwriting my notes the past few days. I'm dangerously close to facing my writing enemy : rushing the plot too fast. And I just remembered what I was planning for these other ones... And my focus. I didn't hit 25K today. Which is absolutely NUTS for me.

Where has this been my whole life? I will I will I will. I've hit the halfway mark! I hope so. I have a feeling a lot of this backstory will be edited out...next month, when I do a rewrite. I have been writing every single day and I'm constantly ahead. I really, really don't want to write today. Today I'm visiting 8th grade classes talking ab writing rough drafts!

Last night, I had one of those "my book sucks" moments. I'm tempted to give up and start a new story, but I'm afraid I'll do the same once I've started that. I think I'm still slightly reeling from that wordcount. Half way home and my pager still blowing up. So I need to write like 4000 words today to catch up with the average! So tired I'm actually dizzy. I am behind my personal quota. I had a late start, due to edits on another book. I'm at that stage in my novel where I think the whole thing is a bad idea. The words are flowing, but I'm not sure this idea can reach 50k words in the end.

Been camping with my laptop and notebooks in Costa for a few hours now. I have words to throw down! Last year was such a fail I don't know what happened. I got a ton down tonight. And now I'm crying (metaphorically) because I'm not even at half of what I should have at this point. I'll be teaching 3rd grade tomorrow and then going to my other job all night. So everyone please excuse me for the bottle(s) of wine next to my writing desk. Immediately regretted those initial caps because my iPhone keyboard hates me. Woke up in my office chair. wish me luck! I'm ready to write some words. Maybe if I focused more on the story as a whole instead of a daily word count I would get more accomplished. I am excited.

Thank goodness I have an adorable love interest blooming to offset the rest of the doom. A Noveltini and witty banter await me... " (I didn't write that, but it's still totally appropriate.) Hitting a word count milestone should surround me with a halo of light. I need Freddie Roach to coach me through it. Come watch me write! I hate when I write a really good line and then nothing... I'm running out of words for the dark. Less than 500 words written and I'm going to bed at 9pm.

I haven't written much today. Can I just say that I love this season? Two days of food poisoning means I haven't been able to sit vertically let alone write anything. I would love to tell your story. WOW I am so happy and I still want to keep writing! Then I'll write more! Then I'll write more! I seriously need to get back to my writing. Now I need to stay up late to get my daily word count. However much of this I realize will be cut, it's forced me to start writing prose. And then I keep writing. I feel quite accomplished. " I have to find a way to sort of let him know without saying it in so many words... " I learnt a lot about myself in the 10 minutes it took to die "I love this line. also love that the characteristics I had planned for both of these kids basically swapped somehow... I'm toying with the idea of killing a character but they're kind of integral to the plot? I love writing!




## Chapter 15 ##

Now I just have to do that 24 more times, and I'll be caught up! And I must say, your app came in quite handy for my research. Ok, I give in to my wrist. I'll go one more hour. 512 more words and I can go to sleep. Excuse me while I worshipfully kiss my own feet. Missed my word count tonight. Hoping I can stay awake long enough to write tonight. Word does pretty much everything I need for writing this stupid book on my iPad. I lost the handwritten pages I had to write while my computer was down. As for my half of this twitter's Novel... Only 12.5k behind my goal now, so I am closing that gap. Cue Bon Jovi's Livin' on a Prayer' cause I'm half way there! Not sure what I should call it.

I've got about an hour to write before bed so shooting for... I'm so glad that "the" counts as a word. Need more jelly babies to sustain me to the end! Safe to say that I'm getting SSB tomorrow! Be sure to send me an email if u'd like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K! Tonight is another night when I can't stay up late because I have to get up early tomorrow. I wrote so few words, I didn't even add them up and add it to my word count. Unfortunately, I have NO idea what happens next. I'm not sure I'll fully catch up, but I'm going to keep going. Just found out that one of my students took "turn off your inner editor" to mean he didn't need any punctuation. I'm feeling pretty good about moving forward now. I'm going to have an amazing word count today. Need more jelly babies to sustain me to the end!

Except I'm not entirely sure what happens in the second half. Thought I'd got over this hump on Monday. Maybe I'll be able to write today if I just whack my head against the wall repeatedly. Now I need a suitable distraction. Okay, let's see how close I can get to 2,500 words! Now to be lazy for a few hours, cause I deserved it. I'm a little stuck now. Also I really don't want to write anything. I haven't heard much about it and I'm still not ready to participate. I need more words. Glad I got on board just before the Go time!

Works better with longer sentences and is way faster than my fingers! Better finish the bag before I try again! Awesome, now to finish my story and maybe start a new one. How many watchlists am I on now? I love symmetrical word counts. 956 words to go until I am completely caught up. Added 2,013 words to my WIP. I just created a character named Johnny Mathis for no real reason, and now my book has a soundtrack. 30,137 words so far...and I'm not even half way through my novel. Attempting to TRIPLE DOWN on my word count today! Still going slow but I mean technically I'm taking a few days "off"... Hit a narrative wall where I'm not entirely sure the rest of the story is going. Think I've just finished one of the most disgusting scenes I've ever written. I like parts of it, but I don't love it. At least I wrote a few hundred words at the auto shop!

Good day for staying warm, listening to music and working on my story. Sure taught me a lesson! Having my writing slump break this morning was amazing. Also my story has become about magic drug dealers. I'll do better tomorrow. I was proud to represent District 5 at the Lust Game. With every WIP I have to go through a process of telling myself that no one will ever read what I'm writing. 31,061 and my editing process is actually netting more words because I'm a horrible human being. How could I modify this just slightly? I just thought if anyone saw my internet search history, I could be in trouble. With all the trips I've taken the past few weeks, I haven't had time to turn on my home computer. 200 words in and I'm not sure my characters are going to like this chapter. Which gets me past the 10k. The antagonist is so evil he's starting to scare me, is that normal??? I'm a little behind but know I can catch up.

I'm super behind. I won't be able to write all day so I'm glad I've got that buffer! Good day for staying warm, listening to music and working on my story. That sounds like a good day to me. I'd need to make sure to be home before dinner, tho! 16,720 total words, and I am feeling pretty marvelous. Headache isn't as bad, so I'm hoping for an extra epic writing day. I hate myself right now. I got started late. Still a little behind but I have til Sat night to hit 25k. Today I will try to push past 20,000 words. and when I say double figures, I mean 10000, not like 12. Today, I discovered the magical power my character has. Good day for staying warm, listening to music and working on my story. Good, I hope.

I was thinking of having something happen to my MC to ruin her good mood, but... I've been good today but I've still got some catching up to do. 700ish more to go, but I took my migraine meds, so maybe! Didn't make a full 1667 today, but with a 12 hr work day and a headcold, I feel good about 1400 or so. I plan to ponder this plot some more while I deal with this commute. I need someone to come tie me up, I need insight into my protagonist's situation. Slowly realizing that all of my male characters have younger sisters and all of my female characters have older brothers. I'm putting down what I have stagnated on to start on something else. I made so much progress yesterday and now I can't get anything done, especially writing because of this stupid headache. I made it past 25,000 words in my novel today. It took longer than usual, but I'm done for the day. Whole family sick and I'm running out of bleach wipes. I think I'm gonna skip out on writing again today but try really hard to kick ass over the weekend. I know I'm doing something wrong with this WIP but I CAN'T TELL and it's driving me nuts. I came in late so managed 665. I think I'll get my word count in late tonight.

I think this sounds like a good plan. What a great supportive family I have. I'm in love with my story! I think I have more in me. " I'm all in, "and he slid over all the childrens gifts. It's either I love my story or I hate it. Less than 500 words to go until I break 25k! I am definitely in the wrong line of work. In case I haven't said it already, writing is hard. At least I'm still putting out words. I think I'll get my word count in late tonight. Need to start to revise so I can feel in the thick of things again.

I mean 50k. I keep telling myself to shower, or eat, or at least brush my teeth... At least I'm trying. I'm at 22.5k words so I am just a little behind. I'm not pleased. I'm doing it too and let me tell you IT IS NOT EASY. I am about half way done with the novel. but I will work harder then I bet have. I'm going to pretend that it's okay I'm still in my pjamas and it's nearly 12. 1500 more words to write to hit my goal of the day. All I am saying is the more the merrier, people and words alike! This full time writing thing is making me very good at putting in eye drops. I need a good mob family name. Woke up with "Go the Distance" from Hercules stuck in my head...today will be a good word count day. After Thursday's flatline, it's good to know I didn't lose the mojo.

I just made my main character blind and I don't know what to do with that. :) I'm procrastinating again! I also think questioning "How good your character is under stress" help reveal alot about them. I'm at 28k, so I had a good 3k day. I have some catching up to do, but I had another good day. I hit fifty thousand words in just half a month. I'm still plodding along in fits and starts. With midnight past, I'm officially 5K behind again. I wrote 3k this morning but now I'm experiencing some serious focus issues this afternoon. I've made it past the 50000 mark! I once went through a phase of excessively using "indeed" in my writing. So many plot inconsistences but I can't change them till December. I guess determining which characters are doomed has been good for my writer's block. I'm writing and it feels so good.

I need to get some serious writing done this weekend. I just wrote like 639 in less than 20 minutes!!! And to show you I mean business : I'm taking a nap. I'm late. I'm closer to being caught up, but still a little under 2,000 words behind schedule. To any NSA agents who might be monitoring me : My recent disturbing search history is just research for my novel, I swear. I'm knee deep in my novel but still behind. Finally, I got to write about something exploding! I think i might actually be able to do this. I have more than 25k now! Good job, me. If what I'm writing is any good won't be known until editing. The good news is I have a sore throat, killer toothache, and no idea what to write.

Still a little behind but I'll get there. I'm ahead of todays target so time to get to half way stage.. I accidentally wrote a thousand words more so I'm at 23k now! I didn't say any of them were good... I feel like a dumb failure today. I'm a bit late I gotta catch up. But I'm sorry it's not actually pig intestines. she just tried to matchmake my gay mc with her best male friend who is in love with her. (I hope) Let's make it a good one.

I'm like 10k behind, so I've got some serious making up to do. I was sick yesterday so it's double word count Thursday for me today. 25080 words.Half way to done with this terrible but oddly compelling (to me) fiction. I also need some sort of serious plot planning or something.. Since I'm writing by hand, my time to stop is usually when my hand starts to hurt and get tired. Slowly realizing that I'm not even halfway through the plot, though... Looks like I'll be staying up late to get it done tonight. Not writing for now bc researching a nutso plot bunny that came at me hard. Not sure what that says about me. Shit I'm calling it. And finish my thesis prospectus! Got a lot of catching up to do on my word count. I guess not being able to sleep is a good thing, means I can catch up! Good thing I have all this coffee. I'd say it's a fair trade. This sounds so good, I almost don't want to write anymore. I don't ogle good looking guys, I surreptitiously glance and then put them in my novel. Let's be honest, I was going anyway!

I don't think I'm gonna be able to write 10k but 5k would be an awesome goal for me. Good thing I've managed to keep up... I slacked a couple days but I'm still ahead, so all is good. Doing so good at procrastinating today, I've decided to take the day off. I love the feeling I get after reaching and surpassing my goal. I'll meet yall on the other side of insanity where the buckets of ice cream are. I made it past 25,000 words today. I've been getting a little behind. I should write at least 10k words but I don't feel like writing. 5,600 words behind par, and not sure how I will catch up. Just in case writing a novel sounds as pretentious as I think it does, let me assure you that mine sucks! Still behind but at least I reached the 20,000 mark. I'm like 10k behind, so I've got some serious making up to do. Late but I did it! Explaining what rooms look like are very hard for me. I've been hard on myself for falling behind, but I wrote over 25,000 words in two weeks, and that deserves a FUCK YEAH GO ME! I'm so tired, though. Let's see if I can get some of the 3k words I'm behind on done as well.

Feels like I left my muse out in the cold. I just sneezed and laughed like it was the funniest thing. Hey girl, the perfect end to any day is one where you read me excerpts of your latest writing project. This is actually amazing for me! I feel a nice glass of celebratory wine is in order! And I still have tonight to add more! Gone past 24K, which means I'm going to go home soon! :(I will get it back by the end of the night! And now I'm 6k behind... I AM SO BEHIND. I haz broken the 25k word count. I bet I can get at least another 600! Not goin 2 b negative, I can do it. Not doing so good today with my story today. I'd say today was a successful day of writing. Also,I am proud that I haven't used "I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding.

I tried REALLY HARD to stop them! Welp, seriously think I'm gonna have problems getting to 50K with this story alone... Now I'm finally past 10k. Oh I've forgotten the joy of writing the mind of someone who gets to hear the harder styles for the first time.. I think it's been a good day. So I just do my own! I'm kinda tired. Hopefully I can step up my game tonight. I am now 4000 words behind. I'm not sure what's wrong with me. I did so badly that time, only 295. I can feel my eyes getting very sleepy :( Thinking I'll head to bed now. Doing good, I think. I'd better go write to make up for this atrocity!!




## Chapter 16 ##

I mean it! I seem to get in the zone around 3pm (Writing Zone or Nap Zone, hard to predict!). Which (for me) is next to impossible. But hey, at least I'm writing. I'm writing 1,667 words a day (on average) and by the end of November I hope to have 50,000. Then I laughed it off. I bid u all a good journey, but question everything otherwise ur doomed to fallacies set in stone,despite good intentions or not. I'd better go write to make up for this atrocity!! I feel like I should win a prize. My wrists are sore, but I am happy. err, writing buddies, and I wanna win. Saturday is my best shot at catching up. Happy to do my part. Lol, I said I was going to be taking a break today, but I ended up writing 3246 words. (You're welcome, everyone else I'll see today.) I make good decisions! I need a good night of rest so I can write some tomorrow before the boy I watch arrives!

I will not cry at my own fic... I am proud that on day 15(halfway), I'm halfway through the word count. I hope you got good writing done anyway! If anybody's sprinting this evening, I'd be happy for the motivation. Woohoo, I'm less than 1,000 words away from 30k! I'm still woefully behind, but I now have A Plan. I'm behind in word count but just passed 15000 words. If I make the word goal for today I get to play a video game. I must be doing a good job because I'm making myself sick. And I hope he lets us win. Good thing I have the day off!

Er, I mean, what slashfic? Just when I thought I had hit a wall I got a great idea for a subplot that's helping. I'm going to get it while the getting is good! It's a good thing I'm sitting at 34K! I can't tell you how happy that makes me. Happy I Love to Write day! Killed a character off, my poor MC. I'm falling behind. I'm behind. I am wayyyyyyyyyy behind on nano, but today is for planning. " Maybe I told them to fuck their mothers. Or at least before I'm booted from the table! Wish I could have hit 2k words, but am happy with the fact that I wrote. I'm feeling good! Even if it's not my best work, I'm building a good habit!

But at least it's keeping me writing! I can collapse happy after a 1,900 word session. I find this fascinating and awesome. 700 words ahead of where I planned to be, that's what I call a successful night! I'll do a happy dance when I reach it. Will I ever reveal whether or not labeling my novel as' Erotic' is just for irony? Turns out my characters didn't walk into a trap, but they are walking on thin ice. But now I'm 5k wds behind. I need an answer to "How was your golf game? Holy crap I'm actually writing a novel! My word count is closing in on 67,000 but I'm still about 3k behind where I wanted to be. I'm so behind. Not that all distractions are bad, or that I haven't enjoyed the distractions of the past two evenings. I'm making great progress but must balance it with revisions. 5,000 more word to go until I hit my word count goal!!! This is the best set up I've ever written.

Going to watch Weeds as a reminder how my life could be so much worse. I'm exhausted. still 1K behind but at least I got some writing done. I am probably inordinately proud of my book, I am not stopping at 50,000 I'm just going to keep going. I'm totally brilliant until I start writing. I may be tired. Words : 23108 it would appear that I am behind again... I AM SO TIRED but m 1,333 words need to be written. You can tell I'm getting tired when all I write about is night time, sleep, and dreaming. I mean, take months to write novels! Anyone have a good prompt for me? Was really happy about my story unfolding yesterday.

I've discovered after some trial and error, i seem to do my best writing between 10pm and 3am. :D Nichelle_Rae is my site profile! I think it's great to write romance in it's purest way. The pain in my chest makes it impossible to relax enough to write! (Still 15K behind where I should be...) I'm 2,000 words behind. That might seem behind, but I'm bursty. I think she's endured enough crap for now. WHY did I write all of these broken bones into my story? Which means I'm behind. 22,000 words and I'm behind. After a break with the family, I have broken 15,000 words. Jeez, and I'm still 5,000 words behind. (I am way behind and trying to catch up.) So I don't even feel a little bad about all the reading. I've been really uninspired today.

It is a challenge, but I am pushing along with the support of my wonderful wife. Whatever you do, I'm proud of you!! Lol I'm also at 32k words so close to finishing! November may the worst month to write a novel and go gluten free, but that's okay because I'm insane. I won't win, but I'm doing it. " I've officially fallen behind. Setting aside my football brain for a moment so I can get in some words before the FSU game. I'm so behind and tired. I'm still woefully behind, but I now have A Plan. Ugh, fell behind because I didn't write for two days. Is it bad that I changed the Game Warden in my novel to a woman because hewasn't very interesting as a man? I'm getting weird looks and lots of questions. I ordered a nano hoodie and feel guilty because nano isn't over. Considering I thought I would fall behind, I just hit the halfway point! And then my muse decided I was wrong. Picturing Peter Capaldi as the Wizard is dangerous because I keep wanting to close every line of his dialogue with "Fuck off.

My characters have never steered me wrong if I just get out of their way. I'm so sorry. I set my alarm for 5:30 and randomly woke up at four. ending my night of noveling at only 1000 words behind, and no longer am I terribly worried. I am litte tired. I think I'm broken. I'm tired and want to go to bed. I'm still 6,000 words behind but making small bits of progress! I'm catching up though! I have this awesome story, but it's covered up by a mudslide of crappy words. I wrote 1,352 words in 30 min this morning, which is the best I've ever done! The best advice I've found is to ignore all advice. That was an awesome sprint for me. hit 20,000 words and I'm feelin awesome, think that i should make writing my career! I'm participating as a' cheater' and proud of it!

Possibly the worst ending sentence I've written in my life, but : draft dance! I stopped 95 words shy of 24k tonight. WHY DO I WRITE DIFFICULT HEROINES? I got bored. " I was wrong about you. And I've just broken halfway! HOW AM I 2,000 WORDS BEHIND? Fuck, I'm out of words to write... Holy fuck I reached par how did I do that? I am heartbroken and happy. I'm really proud of all the progress! I will take that as an awesome start to my day! That was an awesome sprint for me. Not having the greatest day, but I broke 20k!

My word count makes me sad. You know I won't be no perfect Stephen King Clone...so if that's what you're into that go' head and read another tome... Why does the perfect sentence come to me the moment after I put shampoo in my hair? " Despite my best efforts to suppress them, the words lay just below the surface, I'm well behind at the moment. I don't want to get behind! Hearing my wife's stories, and borrowing a name from her day to turn into an illegal chemical supplier. I hit 23k but accidentally stumbled into a awkward, accidental flirting scene which I'm always terrified to write so... Bringing my laptop to a restaurant is my type of "night of writing dangerously. Been trudging my way through this and haven't even gotten to the truly awkward scene yet. Casually getting a ton of muse for something that isn't my nano novel. I'm still behind, but I'm gaining! i'm done with my novel....i'm about 4000 words shy of 50,000. Currenty sitting at 25,073 words and I am happy! Be awesome if I could crack 20,000 words.

Yeah I was wrong my goal is 45k. I'm stuck in the wrong rhyme. I'm so proud of everyone! Hit twenty thousand words and I'm feeling awesome! If I can get it to 85k by the end of the month, I win! 30K and insanely stoked, I think I caught my second wind of ideas! I'm exhausted! Can't sleep bc I have a cold. If there was a National Email Writing Month, I'd be fucking OWNING it... I will now start writing like crazy to try and get 6K so I'm at 110K before tomorrow. This is so difficult omg whyyyyyy am I doing this agaaaiiinnnnn?!... I wanted 1k so badly, but just didn't have it in me that sprint. This book has a lot of awkward moments with characters' mothers, I just realized. Thinking tomato soup for my unhappy throat. I'm declaring victory for having slogged through that awkward scene, and calling it a night. I even gave them guilty thoughts about how wrong it was. Even if I don't reach wordcount today, thats still awesome. I know I'm gonna win this! So I came up with The Best Plan to deal with my inappropriate issues.

I've got it bad. I've used it, but I'd be so afraid to lose my work. I'm declaring victory for having slogged through that awkward scene, and calling it a night. Because I hate you the least. I've got weird priorities. Note to myself in my manuscript : "insert bad word here. I've never had writers block this badly before. I wish I hadn't sucked so bad yesterday, though. I've been in a bad mood ever since. Too bad, I was on a roll. Thinking tomato soup for my unhappy throat. That was an awesome sprint for me. It's like I'm perfect par for day 10!!!...




## Chapter 17 ##

Doing my best to catch up! The best thing about writing a novel is that I can write whatever I want. Despite all my fears and doubts, this is going not too badly. I am honestly shocked I'm still on track... We've surpassed the halfway mark and I'm shocked that I still have something to say. 1745 words tonight...I could keep going, but I fear I am working on fighting being sick and my bed calls. I just opened my novel after two days "sick leave. I've been too sick to write. I was so disappointed.

:(However, I'm crazy close to 22K! I think I made myself sick. I am honestly shocked I'm still on track... Nano is bad for my tweeting habits. You must think me mad! That's how I get my best stuff. But my characters are definitely stupid. Cheering for my awesome antagonist. This has been my best day yet. I hate that I need to go to bed. Crap I'm stuck... Some of my best ideas come while driving... It hates me and I hate it.

I am beginning to find myself exceedingly annoying. I hate flashbacks. I don't know if I can sleep, I'm so excited!!!!! What I hate : my followers leave to support the editing. Procrastination how do I hate thee? Week two slump :(I feel like stopping! Shall try my best to get there. It feels like a never ending wasteland :(I can't wait to be in the 30ks! Horrible confession of the day : Sometimes I purposely leave compounds unhyphenated... The word counting is driving me insane! I think Reanne is my favorite charecter EVER!!!!!
