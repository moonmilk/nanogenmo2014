    <h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>Thus die I, thus, thus, thus. My backup machine ate my last chapter. Any ways I can help out my fellow writers? Cannot think of how to write this scene, so I&#8217;m going to catch up on Sailor Moon Crystal and have lunch. This brings me up to 25,552 for the month of November.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m not doing anything but writing today! While I let that sink in, gonna make some play money. And I NEED to read this book. i&#8217;ve destroyed my plot by trying to outline it and fill in the holes.</p>

    <p>I always end up like this. I did it! I just hit 25879 words! Yesterday hiccups sidelined me.</p>

    <p>Does anyone want to wordsprint with me? I am DOING it! I CAN do it! &quot; I say.</p>

    <p>But I like it! Now to figure out if I can do Book 3 in this month as well! Didn&#8217;t think I would get caught up but, yay! This is the fourth scene I&#8217;ve written where a conversation is taking place over a meal. But my characters need me.</p>

    <p>BUT HOW ELSE CAN I WRITE??? Doesn&#8217;t work and my baby know it&#8217;s November??? &quot; Am I in danger? Come watch me write! I think I can do it!</p>

    <p>Give me your words, then break for 10. I literally vant mm not tuopst. As if I was going through the motions. I do.</p>

    <p>What am I? It looks like I&#8217;m working tommorow. And now I&#8217;m closing my browser and I&#8217;m gonna write. The 1K words I wrote yesterday, might be the biggest breakthrough I&#8217;ve had in over a year. I&#8217;ll listen anytime you u need to talk!</p>

    <p>Thought I hit a wall. Time to get another 2k in on my novel. This is my last sprint with you guys, so let&#8217;s make all the words count! I intend to write like the wind&#8230;</p>

    <p>Oh I forgot to tweet! To avoid getting sicker, I just guzzled the last of my Hydrocodone. Can I push through to 2,000 words tonight?! But after writing 11k in 2 days I&#8217;m starting to catch up so maybe I can do it? I MAY have done enough research to bullshit the hell out of the science in this book.</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s been 21k words since my last chapter break. I don&#8217;t have a clue. I&#8217;ll take it and I&#8217;ll take my bedtime as well. I&#8217;ll take it!</p>

    <p>I had a crisis during my writing time and then life happened. I am DOING it! About to hit 25K on my novella tonight.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m used to writing then editing a short story. &#8230;Oh look, a speck on my wall, guess I&#8217;ll have to sanitize and wash the entire planet. I dont even like dogs. But I did and got over the 1667. AND I broke the 23k mark!</p>

    <p>Haven&#8217;t hit 25k yet but on my way. I take a lot of comfort from it too. I think that&#8217;s a record for me. Let&#8217;s see where I arrive tonight.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll talk to you tomorrow! I need a spark. Another chance to make up my 10k word deficit? Friday night and I&#8217;m at World Coffee writing. Just 600 words, but it brings me up to 23,000!</p>

    <p>So tickled with myself and my Gilda. 25,000 words for me, and there are still three hours left to write at the Evening of Scribing Recklessly! It thinks I&#8217;m listening. Go me!</p>

    <p>I can&#8217;t find it anywhere. If I can get back on par with word count I&#8217;ll post something that shows how I used to connect myself with writing. hurts my spirit. The word &#8220;chortled&#8221; sticks out like a sore thumb to me.</p>

    <p>Now I need to crawl out of my hole and go 2 my day job. &#8220; I prefer the term &#8221;power nuggets. For me?!? Everything I wrote yesterday is lost.</p>

    <p>1st writing session of the day gets me over 25K words. I feel like I am at the doorstep of the the darkest night of the soul. In my defense, I&#8217;ve had a lot of life to contend with. I&#8217;ll have to power through tomorrow to beat you. I have a feeling a lot of this backstory will be edited out&#8230;next month, when I do a rewrite.</p>

    <p>Oh its just research, I said. Fingers cramping means I&#8217;m making progress! I may try to be an ML next year and am looking for resources. I somehow managed to reach my word count for today after getting no sleep last night and running around all day. I wrote 7,000 words today.</p>

    <p>Which character will slubber I wonder. I pledge my word! But I might make it anyway.</p>

    <p>I can&#8217;t believe it. The characters are in control of the story and I&#8217;m just chasing them around with the cursor. I want to break five figures by midnight Sunday.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m now up to 14,611 words. So I&#8217;m at a point of no return. Daughter is now taking a bubble bath while I try to write. Therefore I will be staying in my Marvel pj&#8217;s and having a stream of hammer horror films in the background. If someone said I&#8217;d still be doing this 2 weeks in, I&#8217;d ask &quot;why would you say something like that?</p>

    <p>&#8217; Officially&#8217; ending my word count today on 4322 (39135 total). Finally broke 10K on my novel this month! I&#8217;m not convinced. I guess I&#8217;ll get some morning words in. Work with me, brain.</p>

    <p>I almost got sucked into Pinterest. I intend to reach 30,000 words this evening. I just used Uff da in my novel. 3100 words until I hit my goal.</p>

    <p>I still have around 14K words to write, but gaps and holes to fill, too. All done cleaning the bathroom, and now I&#8217;m gonna show my novel who&#8217;s boss. I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s decaf, I just need it.</p>

    <p>Wish me luck. I don&#8217;t care, internet. I DID IT! I SURRENDER. Another 7000 words and I&#8217;m on track at last. The last thousand should always be the easiest but yet I have 729 words to write and I JUST WANNA SLEEP.</p>

    <p>If you see me on Pinterest or Facebook, give me a virtual slap. I&#8217;ve hit the halfway mark! I&#8217;ve written 5,131 words tonight. Bye bye wifi, I need to disconnect you or I&#8217;ll just procrastinate alllllll day when I could be writing my novel. I&#8217;m all about the word counts, bout the word counts, no edits. Just realized I skipped lunch in my bid to catch up on revision.</p>

    <p>Just gotta write, I&#8217;ll b goin to 1159am 2 make it. just have to keep reminding myself why I started. I feel like banging my head against the keyboard. I DON&#8217;T KNOW.</p>

    <p>I will rise up. Well, I didn&#8217;t see that coming. Time to start going back and adding all the stuff I accidentally rushed last. I think I can, I think I can, I think I can. I shall catch up.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll probably have close to a novel by the end&#8230; (see what I did there?) DM me. No power in the verse can stop me, except running out of tea.</p>

    <p>&quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! And that&#8217;s what I do. How and why did I end up in a sword fight scene? 45 minutes ago I said I was going to bed. Nothing else to do but try, I suppose.</p>

    <p>Maybe I&#8217;ll try this approach again tomorrow! I want to write everything but my novel today. I&#8217;m hooked! Trust me. (Would I make earrings all damn day if I had enough findings and sufficiently diverse beads?</p>

    <p>XXIV : WHAT DO I EVEN DO NEXT IN THIS PLOT. I&#8217; m&#8230; 1230 words on my WIP today. Still short of where I need to be but the night isn&#8217;t over yet.</p>

    <p>By tonight, I will have written 25,000 words. OMG writing this tiny, jewish mambo from queens is killing me! If you are signed up for my newsletter, check your inbox.</p>

    <p>I see you, finish line, and I&#8217;m comin for ya. Noveling makes me hungry. Will just have to redouble my efforts tomorrow. I&#8217;m writing at : 30.</p>

    <p>I haven&#8217;t worked on it since Thursday. Now if I only knew the rest of the story&#8230; I had to stop twice to relieve a&#8230;cramp.</p>

    <p>I can&#8217;t decide what to do. You never glare at me anymore. Gonna write my 2000 and catch up this weekend. Time to put it aside and finish that short story I was working on in October.</p>

    <p>Writing in the morning brings out my productive side. I don&#8217;t know why, but every word feels like a struggle tonight. I don&#8217;t feel like writing today&#8230; What have I done?! Before you chain me to the computer like a slave again&#8230;</p>

    <p>I just can&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I started writing before 10pm&#8230; If I write 1000 words every day, I make wordcount. I am stuck at 20k. How the hell did I manage 2,400 words across 10 A5 pages?</p>

    <p>1k before I get a cup of coffee? I just wrote my way from Cyprus to Halicarnassus. I like writing romance in middle grade, I&#8217;m finding. I can make that up.</p>

    <p>In case anyone was wondering : Sir Bedivere is my dude. I guess I&#8217;ll be writing on my phone for the rest of the night? I&#8217;m a writer, just keep on writing! &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days!</p>

    <p>Gonna hit 50K words if it kills me! Soon, I will have to write some romantic scenes. Alright, I&#8217;ve brushed my teeth and reheated my tea. 6500 words today and I just hit 30,000.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m at 71k and i need to be at 90k by midnight tomorrow (or done with the book altogether.) Tonight I started at 44,019 and am ending at 46,029. Did I mention that words are happening? &quot; If you don&#8217;t want to lose me, TELL me.</p>

    <p>I AM SUCH A SLACKER. I worked on my book today. I have a goal for the end of this book, you are not included ma&#8217;am. Can I do it? I&#8217; ll.</p>

    <p>I woke up today with an urge to lie in bed all day and write. i need someone to motivate me. One of my characters is changing and I don&#8217;t like it. I feel like it&#8217;s eating my life. Someone talk some sense into me, please?</p>

    <p>To make myself write I told myself that if I wrote 3k in 1.5 hours I could watch Legend of Korra until I didn&#8217;t want to anymore. Trying to reach 6000 words before I go to sleep, stay with me brain!</p>

    <p>Sunday is actually my fave writing day. my word count is at 16,230 today. 365 for me. &quot; I say.</p>

    <p>Off to get my word count in for the night! 370 on my last sprint. On the cover of this book, I&#8217;ll include a warning : &quot;Do not read if dieting. I am 1K away from being all caught up. p.s. oh yes I&#8217;ll be counting those excised words, don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m not.</p>

    <p>Whatever, it works toward my word count now. 26,010 and I&#8217;m done for the night! I wrote 1686 train words!!! Dear Monsanch, Whhy in my head do you look like Viggo Mortensen in Eastern Promises? I shall struggle on.</p>

    <p>Now I must sleep. I can do this. Someone force me to be productive. As I leave my character asking a phone sex operator for therapy, my word count is : 14,603.</p>

    <p>&#8217;&#8217; I think nothing will be spared. I wrote 1698 words today and I have 22,165 total. Go me! The emotion returned, and guided me.</p>

    <p>Mopping up my feels now. Now I can cook the kids tea and write! I have no motivation to write at all. I have now surpassed 40k words. 25,002 words at the end of my last paragraph.</p>

    <p>At 30k, it&#8217;s been 11 days in my novel. Instead I&#8217;m on twitter. I still haven&#8217;t learned to turn Facebook off when I try to write. I&#8217;m moving house.</p>

    <p>I need a breakthrough or something. I felt relief, and then blushed with shame at my relief. I can&#8217;t be stopped. Ending my procrastination. Now I want cake. My writers tried to warn me but those words you got make me so wordy!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m turning off the internet. It was driving me nuts. Last chapter tonight, then I must sleep. For me?!?</p>

    <p>Losing my rag here&#8230; I reached my goal of writing 5k today. Tell me how your sprint went. I am doing both way and allow my mind pour out. I feel like bursting into song&#8230; I have to start writing again tomorrow.</p>

    <p>That&#8217;s my story, anyway. I wrote 2500 words today. And finish my thesis prospectus! help me.</p>

    <p>I need to get some writing in. Check my FB 5songs for others. And another thousand words fill my page, onward! It took 45 minutes by I am now caught up and HALFWAY! And now I stand looking out from the walls of 32k. I think that&#8217;s a sufficient amount of Phosothop for today.</p>

    <p>Don&#8217;t stop me Smee. I need a variation of Tellervo. Back up to having a fighting chance with my word count!</p>

    <p>&quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! I&#8217;m eating a lot of apple slices and trying to finish these 1,500 words before midnight. I wish fall could be here to stay forever. I am at 40K words!</p>

    <p>Maybe I&#8217;ll try this approach again tomorrow! Think I will finish it tomorrow. Remember those 47 words I was expanding yesterday? I just don&#8217;t have the time to write. I got 603.</p>

    <p>I just signed on and saw this! I need words. But I do like the way you add to my word count. &#8220; &#8221;Nothing, my dear Frodo. Planning to write some scenes out of order just because they are in my head now!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been writing on my phone almost all day, hoping to update my word count with a big number later! Plus I know what happens next! No, I&#8217;m not doing any of that. Some nights I only wrote 200 words.</p>

    <p>Why does it take me four hours to write 1K words if I start at 9 a.m. and only an hour if I start at midnight? I think that&#8217;s a record for me. The plot thickens as my brain mushens. &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m telling myself that I&#8217;m not going to write anymore tonight, but we all know that isn&#8217;t going to happen. I&#8217;m rocking this. I don&#8217;t quit. I&#8217;m in the hole 6,000 words, which isn&#8217;t daunting at all. I&#8217;ll watch one episode then get back to writing!</p>

    <p>Let me count the ways, 1, 2, 3 oh look, Twitter! I definitely need to get caught up on my WC, either way! I have 3800 to go to reach 30k today&#8230; If I get to 4000 today, I&#8217;ll meet Tuesday&#8217;s goal already. I&#8217;m only about a quarter in.</p>

    <p>I am such a 90s child! Still have the afternoon ahead of me. Got my 1,738 I was looking for. Why didn&#8217;t I make it to 10,000 words?</p>

    <p>I wrote 3638 words in an hour&#8230; And I have a twist I&#8217;m about to throw in. Now I need sleep. Oh hey, I just passed 25,000 words on my second book! I am DOING it!</p>

    <p>I just put my headphones on so I wouldn&#8217;t disturb the cat. I&#8217;ve suddenly decided to take up French again. In two chapters, my protagonist went from eating croissants to suffering from gangrene and eating roadkill. I did it.</p>

    <p>Question : What three things are in my NaNoWriMo novel? Hi ho hi ho it&#8217;s off to plot I go. My MC is falling in love with the wrong character, but I&#8217;m just going to go with the flow. It&#8217;s writing time and I don&#8217;t feel like it one bit. I&#8217;ve written over 20,000 words.</p>

    <p>Working on one of the final scenes in my novel! I literally have a gun to his head and I&#8217;m having second thoughts. I got this! I just hit a 20,000 word milestone, yay!</p>

    <p>Now I&#8217;m going to try to make it to 100k and the end of the story. I told a friend it took two hours to write 1k words. People in my hall need to stop slamming doors. If I have all day, it takes all day. I have nightmares that cliches are coming to get me.</p>

    <p>What if I&#8217;m just a rock?&#8230;I&#8217;m going to try anyway. I think my appetite is gone&#8230; Contact me.</p>

    <p>I have a feeling a lot of this backstory will be edited out&#8230;next month, when I do a rewrite. Managed to get my daily target WC in before midnight. She sounds like my daughter. Man, I need a nap.</p>

    <p>Typed it all up and my word count is 14,673 as of now. I did, it, clan! I&#8217;ve passed the 11.5k point. I think I&#8217;m going to finish and edit it!</p>

    <p>I might just have to go for it and finish 50,000 by tomorrow. I go drink some alcohol now. I make a point of trying to put aside my editing during it. I need to transfer my anguish to my characters. Let&#8217;s see if I can crank out another 2.5K words again today.</p>

    <p>Now I can veg out for a bit. Wondering if I could reach 50k today&#8230; I&#8217;m still at 20k. I got two choices y&#8217;all read the review or ignore so I&#8217;m not gonna bounce my pedal to the floor&#8230;</p>

    <p>I will I will I will. With every WIP I have to go through a process of telling myself that no one will ever read what I&#8217;m writing. I made it! REPEAT : I HAVE PASSED THE HALFWAY POINT.</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m supposed to get him and his car home. I&#8217;m at a stopping point. And then I accidentally made my 2 mc&#8217;s adopted sisters and my entire plan for this story came to a screeching halt. I will go to bed in 24 minutes.</p>

    <p>50K, here I come! Maybe I need to sleep on it.</p>

    <p>Can you give me some words? (Never thought I&#8217;ll say that!) I am going to bed. At this point I need several Allnighters or several 10k days&#8230; Work and life getting in the way of getting my word counts up!</p>

    <p>Maybe I&#8217;ll do it next year! I want to know! I think I&#8217;m going to be doing that &#8220;Three months later&#8221; things movies do. Cut me.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m not participating but am cheering for those who are! I managed to catch up! Come join me! I need a nap&#8230; SO unlike me.</p>

    <p>I tried. At this rate, I will be ending the month at 40K words instead of 50K. Before I write another word Javert! Finally decided what I want for Christmas.</p>

    <p>The career author beat me. Know what I haven&#8217;t put in a story in a while? I hope it doesn&#8217;t clog the drain. It&#8217;s 2am and I&#8217;m already ahead of par for today! as of 11.59pm tonight I&#8217;m supposed to be on 25k. Nag me or inspire me&#8230;</p>

    <p>I need motivation. I fully intended to skip tonight, but somehow I got in over 1700 words! I am DOING it! Before you chain me to the computer like a slave again&#8230;</p>

    <p>Writing the end scene is always the hardest, I think. Got my cacao nut latte, got my tunes, hordes are outside playing. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to hit 50,000 words for National Novel Writing Month but I did just pass 15,000. Wish me luck. &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days!</p>

    <p>After 14 days my dog has learned he&#8217;s not getting fed in the morning until after I write 1,667 words!. I cranked out 2028 words tonight. So, I&#8217;m bringing my laptop to a restaurant, and literally sit there while my family chat. I feel energized. Taking a break then trying to get 6958 I need to finish.</p>

    <p>Don&#8217;t they understand I have a word count to attain. Stared outlining from the middle on this piece, realized I was way out of sync. I&#8217;m not even a quarter of the way through yet.</p>

    <p>If all goes according to plan today I&#8217;ll hit 25K words aka HALFWAY DONE! Conundrum : I have tonight to myself. Who&#8217;s with me?? Universe trying to tell me something? I&#8217;m not out of the race yet! 20882 total for me.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m sipping wine and reading a book. On the upside, I get to spend all of December watching my November DVR&#8217;d shows. I write. Wanted to to 2.5K again but am losing my temper. Now I have five.</p>

    <p>Need to finish my current book. I celebrating tonight. Come join me! Can I hit 20k before bed?</p>

    <p>Without my permission, I swear! I give myself a stern nod in the mirror. I might still write, but at a slower pace until I go to sleep. Word sprints are in my future!</p>

    <p>After a lax weekend I need to write 4,000 today. I got this though! Did not hit 10k but my goal for today is 25,000 words. Wish me luck because I WILL FINISH.</p>

    <p>I started off pantsing. Today is one of those days where I want to bang my head against the keyboard until the novel writes itself. added another 4k to my word count today. I&#8217;ve lost my writing momentum.</p>

    <p>Gonna go kill all my characters off, bye. I wrote 10,012 words today at our midway party! and i think that&#8217;s all i have in me today. Might have to have my cookies as a bribe to keep going rather than a reward. Not making my word goals, but writing every day.</p>

    <p>I only wrote 744 words today but that was enough to pass the halfway point! Tomorrow : need to build a word cushion so you and I have big plans after Mass. Write and write my Wordlings. Don&#8217;t tell me if it&#8217;s the last one, I&#8217;m a giant baby.</p>

    <p>Why do I dread writing tomorrow? I&#8217;ve never gotten emotional over a character before. That&#8217;s what I get for choosing to continue a started book.</p>

    <p>I blatantly need more tea. I won&#8217;t give up! I&#8217;m Boss Level at Being Distracted. I&#8217;m going in. Makesstrange sense to me now.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m hitting my stride as I approach 30,000 words, but could use a foot rub and a calf massage. I might actually make it with this novel! I am DOING it!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m feeling another 5,000 words on the tips of my fingers! Shake them fingers and toss me those counts. I wish my tweets counted toward my word count. Thought : Maybe if I had wine NOW, writing would be easier.</p>

    <p>Write for 30 minutes, meet me back here! If my tweets this morning are any indication on the quality of my sleep deprived writing&#8230; I have some ideas for the next bit too. I did I! I thought we were pals! I WON!!</p>

    <p>Maybe I&#8217;ll introduce smurf unicorns. &quot; I have writing to do, A WORD COUNT TO MEET! Oh my gosh!!! I have passed the halfway point. I think I&#8217;ve earned a day off, don&#8217;t you?</p>

    <p>I reached par tonight and my word count goal. I MADE IT, I&#8217;M HERE, I SURVIVED THIS DAY. No work for me today! I caught up!</p>

    <p>If I have all day, it takes all day. I want to hit 25k today! Looks like I&#8217;ll finish before vacation starts! I&#8217;m outlining a short dystopian! Who&#8217;s with me?</p>

    <p>My eyes are getting fuzzy, so I&#8217;m going to call it a night&#8230; I just wrote about Yelp in my WIP. And it took all day but I made it. Guessing this won&#8217;t be the year I&#8217;ll finish this novel. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve crossed the event horizon, and I can&#8217;t make my way back. &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days!</p>

    <p>Can I do it? I might actually finish this thing! Yelling at my characters when they start derailing the story. Yes, I did just feed my child Pop Tarts and a pudding cup for dinner. Now I wish I knew how to play an instrument.</p>

    <p>Or I&#8217;m just in a funky part of my MS. Maybe I&#8217;ll just skip to arc three after this scene. Of course when I want to get some writing done my computer just doesn&#8217;t work. Damn you, sickness, thwarting my plans!</p>

    <p>Why did I do this to myself? Trying to keep writing and stay up until my husband gets home from work, but this rain is making me sleepy. I&#8217;m off to bed. My computer&#8217;s power supply is gone, so I&#8217;m writing in my notebook like an animal. Say, I passed the 20k word mark today in the WIP! I am DOING it!</p>

    <p>I just passed the 25000 word mark! It uploaded on my phone yesterday, but never showed up on the internet. finally, a sentence describing my plot that makes sense. I had no idea what to name two of the lands in my story, so I&#8217;ve been calling them Minaj and Drake. I think that&#8217;s a record for me. Whom has set this next book I&#8217;m writing INSIDE that home! Did I?</p>

    <p>I wish I had already written all that stuff that is jumping around in my head. Otherwise I might weep. almost halfway to my goal of 30,000 with 14,886 words&#8230; Hear me roar.</p>

    <p>Not that this means anything as my personal target is wildly different. I&#8217;m only at 19,900! Ten minutes left in the day for me and I just hit 20,000 on the spot! Write for 30 minutes, meet me back here! Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t? I will cross 25k today.</p>

    <p>Think my book needs pirates in it. I must. Why am I so inspired by anything except what I should be writing? cause it so speaks to my novel.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll sleep on it and finish tmrw! I&#8217;m looking forward to rewriting! I so wish I had written last night, but I&#8217;m finally back on track with my word count. Because I am always facetious. Inner editor and inner critic : I do believe you were both placed on leave without pay until the end of the month.</p>

    <p>21 K. I will reach 25 K today, and I am going to finish this thing next weekend if it kills me. And my brain is so frazzled, I almost didn&#8217;t make that connection. I have pjs on and earplugs in and manuscript open. I find it easier to write about murder than to describe my MC&#8217;s living room.</p>

    <p>My word count is crawling along today, like I&#8217;ve suddenly defied the laws of mathematics. I have a feeling the word count is about to be easier than ever to achieve! Over 2000 words written today and I&#8217;m still going! 488 words until I reach the day 16 target. On my way to 38.000!</p>

    <p>Does my novel even have a plot anymore? Don&#8217;t know if this counts for anything, but my story is now 60 pages!! 1700 words at lunchtime brings me to par for today.</p>

    <p>Yeah my mama she told me don&#8217;t worry about your edits&#8230; Getting my writing groove back. 671 words that sprint and my 1st words of November. I just had my story pass the Bechdel Test. NaNoNaNoNaNoNaNo is just running through my head to the tune of 60&#8217;s Batman.</p>

    <p>I have made it to 25,000 words. I lured him outside with bits of granola bar. Submissions for magazine short stories coming in and I can&#8217;t get enough!</p>

    <p>All I do is write and overthink stuff. Do I have energy to write words to night. I am doing this. Novel excerpt : I now had my trusty fork.</p>

    <p>Today I&#8217;m going to put a dent in the word count. However, it does seem to be 25077 words of total poop, so I may need to take the next year to edit. &#8220; I shooky my head &#8221;and&#8220; balzer &#8221;instead of blazer. Just take my money. I&#8217;m not sure what to do with a first draft that&#8217;s not begging to be written.</p>

    <p>I managed to write 12,185 at my last write in, putting me over the hump of 90k. Yes I have caught up my word count, but I now ache everywhere. At this rate, I&#8217;ll be done in six days. Had another 5k day and my word count just cleared 60,000!</p>

    <p>I just have one question&#8230; 700 words before I sleep. Think that I have what it takes? I have rediscovered my dream.</p>

    <p>All my words are still there after the reboot and updates. End of the day, I&#8217;m at 17,215 words! I wish I could just sit in the library all day and write&#8230; She is quite the conflicted slave, I must say.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve had a cocktail, you see. Do I sleep or do I write? To Do list : 1) Everything that has been distracting me from writing. I suggest you hit Blonde&#8217;s Pizza in Berkley before you leave.</p>

    <p>I wrote 8 one page stories today. I can&#8217;t feel my butt. I&#8217;m not even participating this year! Rounded out my day 12 total with 42k. I don&#8217;t fee like writing today. I need a NaNoWriMo nap.</p>

    <p>I regret this scene. I got a lot written just then. I have done this. About to hit 25K on my novella tonight. I am DOING it.</p>

    <p>I just made a really big decision about my storyline. (My goal is 15k by the end of today, but maybe I should increase it&#8230;) I don&#8217;t know if I can do it&#8230; Dear Life : Please see my rescheduling attempts re:December. I am so inspired by her and ALL of my clan!!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m close to 5,000 words. I do a lot of handwriting in my notebook that way I can type like a champion when I get on the computer. At my desk and everything! Beat my 800 word goal.</p>

    <p>I should hit 25k by Friday. Now I may go cook some. I give up on going back to sleep. I am DOING it!</p>

    <p>If you&#8217;re sprinting with me I&#8217;ll see you at the : 55! I know there isn&#8217;t but I want there to be. I have done 10k in a day. I&#8217;m on fire! I onbuttoned the vidscreen and browserpopped to twitter. Thoughts for my story?</p>

    <p>I haven&#8217;t slept yet&#8230; Send me your word count and your Hogwarts house, so I can award house points! Do you think I can do it? Running a spell check so I can see the grade level at the end?</p>

    <p>I like what you&#8217;ve done with your hair. 12k on my novel. I&#8217;m gonna make 1k yet! I recommend the Squirrel Feeding Procrastination Technique.</p>

    <p>Only 888 words to go until I&#8217;m at 35k! Today my characters are captured and brought to a camp who&#8217;s leader is a dictator of sorts. A BEAST I TELL YOU!!! Time to focus on my screenplay after this! I might just have to go for it and finish 50,000 by tomorrow.</p>

    <p>I just lost 3000 words. The emotion returned, and guided me. You get me to write! What should I be doing?</p>

    <p>One of my chs used paleography and hist bib to work out where the mysterious book had come from&#8230; You are not going to make me cry in Starbucks! The one I started in November 2012 but still! I&#8217;m gonna stop writing for now and mourn for his sacrifice now&#8230;</p>

    <p>Maybe I&#8217;ll start a nrw story. Oh by the powers vested in me&#8230; After being too chemo to write yesterday, I&#8217;m back writing tonight. Uping my word count while on the bike at the gym using Goigle Docs on my phone! Guess I&#8217;ll roll with it.</p>

    <p>If one word could change your life forever, I know what it would be. And now I&#8217;m caught up. Or maybe I&#8217;m not, but it&#8217;s going to happen this afternoon regardless. Now I am too.</p>

    <p>7k words from par and I&#8217;m still writing! Should I kill myself? This tale&#8217;s got control of me. At 9,051 words for today and 21,118 words total, I&#8217;m officially caught up! I can&#8217;t write&#8230;.I am out of ideas&#8230;.help?</p>

    <p>I can&#8217;t wait to start writing again! I broke 20K! Looks like I&#8217;m pulling an all nighter..this story needs to get done. 45k, I am totally in you. I need to get writing.</p>

    <p>I am DOING it! Hit my 100k then kept on writing. Archangel reveal, here I come!</p>

    <p>&#8220; I think I&#8217;ll try to get to 50K words today, &#8221;I thought after waking this morning. Today I am shooting for 20k words. I&#8217;m not finished either!</p>

    <p>NaNoWriMo Day 12 Written Today 9,306 Total Words 45,006 Can I finish 2morrow? No word wars for me tonight. I managed 1,132 words during that sprint. Using coldturkey to ensure that I get writing done.</p>

    <p>In last night&#8217;s dream I turned Neverland into Candyland by eating antimatter. HAVE I WATCHED VERONICA MARS. And my focus. I would&#8217;ve gotten there last night, but migraine.</p>

    <p>1AM and I just smashed the halfway mark. I suppose I will open Word at some point during the day. Now if my mutinous Trigeminal nerve will let me. I just reached 25,803 words. Within the next hour, I shall hit and pass the halfway mark!</p>

    <p>Just passed the 35000 word mark on my novel in progress. Today I managed 2509. This is what happens when I don&#8217;t outline a climax and ending. I will need a month or so to edit it. Wordcount has now reached 80,015, which means I&#8217;m still on par for 150k!</p>

    <p>Repented for my sin of not writing anything for the last 3 days. I have the energy of a dishrag soaked in Valium. Today is my push day. On migraine day 3 and I smell like an apothecary.</p>

    <p>Go me. &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! I am back to hand writing on paper.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve totally got this. My fingers are waiting, but my brain is not transmitting&#8230; And I&#8217;m all caught up with time to spare. I wrote sixty words. I&#8217;m a novelist.</p>

    <p>Something in my fridge was growing mold so I wrote a short story about it. I think a 100:1 ratio of potential to putrid prose. I MUST! Broke for pizza, put kiddo to bed, and now I&#8217;ve lost all momentum.</p>

    <p>I know where it&#8217;s going, but the path changes. Now to attempt to write another 2k before I sleep off this headache! I&#8217;ve got this. I am DOING it! But I&#8217;ve got 2000 words to go, so I&#8217;m going to shun you all for a bit. I&#8217;m 16k behind and I&#8217;ve dug a hole so deep I can&#8217;t see the light anymore.</p>

    <p>Finished my freelancing project for today. I made a mistake about 10 pages ago. &#8220; MC : &#8221;Are you talking about me or the bed? I feel like I&#8217;m not gonna finish in time. Then I can do all the reading and Lego LOTRing I want!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll try to remember to link you when I&#8217;m done. Might quit while I&#8217;m ahead. I&#8217;ve never written so much in such a short amount of time in my life. I hit 2,000 words for tonight (that&#8217;s 24k total, if you&#8217;re counting).</p>

    <p>I contemplate giving up. The blue dye is in my hair. I do have 2K words ahead of me I want to write. &#8220; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! I caught up to par! Time to procrastinate, all the while complaining about how I didn&#8217;t &#8221;have enough time&quot; for this. Also, I reached the end of what I&#8217;d actually plotted out before hand.</p>

    <p>I hope it stresses the reader. I&#8217;m just over 10,000 words away. I&#8217;m finishing a WIP and then moving on to something else. Which means I just need to write about twenty thousand words today to catch up.</p>

    <p>For the next 15 days, I&#8217;ll only work on book 4, which I&#8217;ve been neglecting in favor of book 3. Once I write 2,000 words today, I shall reward myself with the newest Sailor Moon Crystal episode. I might be plotting things for the midway party on the 16th&#8230; I am dreading the day when I reread this&#8230;</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m getting to a juicy part in the story. How would I feel if the events were happening to me? Looking at what I&#8217;m going to write today and lulzing at myself. I will double my word count by Monday&#8230; I&#8217;ve written some words.</p>

    <p>Perfectionism is my fiercest inner demon. Here&#8217;s hoping I can get it up to 22,000 before bed! So back I go&#8230; I like the voice of my MC. I&#8217;m psyched.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m almost reaching 1K, but boy has it been excruciating. Feeling like I&#8217;ve climbed a mountain. As I write this I&#8217;m constantly thinking does this character have a strength or dexterity check for this? I need to get back on the writing horse. Starting my day of writing.</p>

    <p>And that&#8217;s what I do. Does anybody foresee a copyright issue with my story about an Australian boy wizard named Barry Cotter? tbh I can&#8217;t get myself to write.</p>

    <p>Next section is worked out, but don&#8217;t have it in me to write it now. I&#8217;ll take it. Had to meet my word quota for today and I did.</p>

    <p>But I wrote 2,000 words today. I made it halfway! I can do this! &#8220; &#8221;Nothing, my dear Frodo.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m actually developing a plot now! I&#8217;ve decided November will my month of decadent indulgence. I don&#8217;t know.</p>

    <p>When you don&#8217;t physically have shoulders cuz you&#8217;re a ball of slime : &#8220;You can cry on my, er, lack of shoulder. &#8221; My imagination never gives me a choice. &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! And I wouldn&#8217;t mind a three book contract too.</p>

    <p>But I still do it. I was SUPPOSED to split this big chunk between yesterday and today&#8230; I hope. AND I SHALL. I am doing this.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m FINALLY writing! Do I make 25k tonight? I&#8217;ve had a couple of 2k days and I&#8217;m almost caught up! But to do it all I a smartphone&#8230;. I&#8217;d thought when I started if I just kept writing, sooner or later something would come to me.</p>

    <p>I hit the halfway mark, and I finished ch. This was not what I had in mind! I&#8217;ve been writing for two hours, but still haven&#8217;t cracked 2K in that time. cleaning my apartment. Titled my novel today! I think.</p>

    <p>Is this my novel&#8217;s way of telling me I need a life? Stopping at 10,189 words, exceeded the count for the day, even if I haven&#8217;t begun to catch up. I know tons of work for the sheer amount of people. These twelve hour days at work are hurting my word count. I can do this!!!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve topped 30,000 words now and I&#8217;m like, How am I going to end this with just 20k words left? I am DOING it! 26k words in and I JUST figured out my plot twist! I wrote 1,479 words AND I hit 40k overall in the process!</p>

    <p>Can I stop time for a day so I could catch up on my word count? Almost to the end of my outline though&#8230; &#8217; I&#8217;m with you on that Hemingway. Got my word count to 26,763 today. Today&#8217;s the day I&#8217;m halfway to 50k! I might do it again!</p>

    <p>I am writing a book at midnight. In the process of rebuilding my website, essentially from the ground up. But I have the week off, so writing away! 21314 words in&#8230;only 3686 left till I hit the halfway point!</p>

    <p>&quot; How about we meet at Local Coffee at 5, and I&#8217;ll take Caldwell grocery shopping and you can write at Local? I might just have to go for it and finish 50,000 by tomorrow. aka my kitchen worktop. If this rate keeps up, I&#8217;ll be done by November 30th after all. I miss writing my airport time travel story though.</p>

    <p>I gotta a gaming itch. I&#8217;m doing well. I&#8217;m halfway there!</p>

    <p>Only wrote 800 words today, and it&#8217;s all history, not story, but I think I&#8217;ve rerailed the train before it could crash. Literally every time someone walks into my room while I&#8217;m writing, I lost my train of thought. Yes, I&#8217;m hearing that the Fortress of 25k has crumbled! Ugh. No idea where I even found the strength for that session. Need to do some further chapter plans tomorrow I think. So I gotta catch up tomorrow! I crossed 40k.</p>

    <p>I lost 1,000 words. &quot; I can take this with me. Just killing my darlings&#8230; Except I called it a forum, so nonline people get it too. Wish me luck.</p>

    <p>I started way before. And I&#8217;m halfway done!! &#8220; Since you obviously don&#8217;t speak girl, &#8221;Maddy says,&quot; let me translate for you. 1731 words and I&#8217;m gonna come up for some air.</p>

    <p>I am DOING it! I aim to write 15k (hit 25k) by 12am Sunday. Getting closer to my 50k! (And yes, I see the irony&#8230;)</p>

    <p>I just don&#8217;t know! Wish me luck. I think I&#8217;ve become way too attached to my characters. My goal is 10k words today to catch up to where I should be. And I got them out of the hospital!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m shooting for 3K today. Have recovered from nauseating headache (I think). I&#8217;m just working on getting 200 words written at a time. I&#8217;m starting a 30 minute word sprint on Write or Die now.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m thinking maybe write for 40 mins? I will never skip a day again. Thank god I am ahead on my word count. 1,800 words tonight and I&#8217;m calling it quits. I wanna write with ya!</p>

    <p>AND I did HOMEWORK. I have got to get faster at writing fiction. I&#8217;m going to write like a maniac tonight. I like the voice of my MC. And that&#8217;s what I do. I&#8217;m off to write it!</p>

    <p>Racist Pages keeps trying to autocorrect my character&#8217;s name from &#8220;Shonda&#8221; to &quot;Rhonda. I&#8217;ve sidetracked myself with this subplot. Wish me luck! Let&#8217;s see if I can bang out another 1500. I am DOING it!</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t know. My tummy decided to make dying whale sounds to remind me. Tomorrow my goal is to break 21,000! basketball is my life.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll try for 5,000 though. Just my tea and me&#8230;and my novel! &#8230;and then I needed to remember the name of the gang in the coastal town nobody&#8217;s visited in the book yet. Ultimately, I want to write a book, where my readers are so engrossed, they forget all together, that it&#8217;s a story&#8230; I need another thousand words in the next two hours.</p>

    <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>I&#8217;m ready to write some words. Going to pretend I&#8217;m writing Groundhog Day and just copy and paste the whole thing a second time. Just when I&#8217;m ready for all my rowdy friends to settle down, I discover they are growing mustaches and writing novels. Is there any chance I could get it all done by Thanksgiving? I ended up with 489.</p>

    <p>I sometimes can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m doing this&#8230;but I am. And y&#8217;all, my brain, omg. I really need to buckle down and get writing for my novel. Nearly 6pm and I still have to start peeing 5k words&#8230; The end is in sight, but I&#8217;d really rather have a nap.</p>

    <p>I finally did some outlining. I have officially PULVERIZED 30k. I think my heroes might be walking into a trap&#8230; Writing, writing, writing til my eyes bleed, writing when it&#8217;s easy, writing when it&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;m not in love with my novel and I keep emotionally cheating on it with all the other novels I could be writing instead. Fast forward to this year : I just got IN bed.</p>

    <p>I am DOING it! I apparently write pretty functionally on 5 hours of sleep&#8230; I am DOING it! I had the last two days off and managed to do three days worth of work in two so I&#8217;m going to take today off.</p>

    <p>Anybody want to sprint with me at : 30 for 25 minutes? At 37k and am hoping I have a few more words in me before bedtime. I&#8217;m scared! I&#8217;ll be starting my first 5k sprint tonight at 10:30 UTC if anyone wants to join me.</p>

    <p>Not sure Gorgon City is the right music for this row I&#8217;ve been avoiding. If I write 9k today I&#8217;ll be completely caught up. I don&#8217;t know why, but I have an urge to play video games today&#8230; I&#8217;ve been procrastinating too much today.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m such a wimp. I wrote nearly 5000 words today. I lost the tiara. I took two days off so have pretty much put myself behind where I wanted to be. During NaNoWriMo, I&#8217;m having more trouble keeping to my normal schedule than ever.</p>

    <p>Still a bit behind but I can easily catch up at this rate. I&#8217;m at 1,341 words for the day so far. I feel like I should be screaming, &quot;IT&#8217;S ALIIIIIIVE! It&#8217;s a miracle I got that much done.</p>

    <p>That&#8217;s why I use them. That&#8217;s 900 words I didn&#8217;t have written this morning. One day I&#8217;m going to spell reminiscent correct the first time round. I&#8217;m up to 657 words so far. I had to kill someone I had really grown to like this morning.</p>

    <p>three pages of my two main characters discussing why aliens wear clothes and if they have naughty bits. So far I have Sumerian, Sanskrit, Latin, HIndi, Welsh, and Arabic influenced names in my novel. I must have written 10,000 words today. I am going to regret this so much in the morning.</p>

    <p>Bed was very tempting, but I managed to make quota. There&#8217;s a possibility my characters need to stop getting ready now and actually get to the party they&#8217;re going to&#8230; The words, they elude me! I noticed you haven&#8217;t updated the website recently!</p>

    <p>Ended up with my total word count at 32323. I&#8217;m a frickin genius!! Really busy day, but I managed to write 1209 words on the bus, during my lunch hour, and during my break. I didn&#8217;t realize how much time has passed I was so in the zone.</p>

    <p>I think I&#8217;m done. I just wrote 697 words today. I&#8217;ve written all the exciting parts of my story, now I just need to fill in the gaps.I&#8217;m low on inspiration.</p>

    <p>9,671 words until my novel is officially finished. Maybe I&#8217;m inspired to add a few more&#8230; Does anyone know if I&#8217;m allowed to mention brand names in my book? Hopefully I can get a few more words in before I go to sleep.</p>

    <p>somehow managed to not notice that I changed a character&#8217;s name until now. I despise coming back to reality. Realized today that with 31k under my belt so far this is the longest single piece of fiction I&#8217;ve ever written solo! 23,498 is my word count so far today. I&#8217;m not proud about my word count, but I&#8217;m proud about not having given up.</p>

    <p>I really need to have a big day to boast me up a little. It tells me I&#8217;m not writing fast enough! Got a lot going on today, but still managed to bump my word count to 10,563. I&#8217;m learning, if I write straight through it, I can do about 1k every 20 minutes.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m gonna. Just lost about 1k of my word count, which means I had duplication in my &#8220;complete&#8221; file. Making it to 40k is my goal for tonight. I just can&#8217;t decide if this is a real problem or not.</p>

    <p>I feel torn between trying to get another 1000 or going out to have beer and scotch. 25,645 is my word count so far. So I know what to do with Luke. Now to REALLY build a cushion so that I&#8217;m not noveling in a tryptophan haze.</p>

    <p>after an awesome night of writing dangerously, I am up to 43,334. It was my lowest word count so far. But, I&#8217;ve written myself into these 3 characters being together. I wrote 641 words this morning! And then I keep writing.</p>

    <p>The break came SEVEN words before I finally would have passed 25K! I&#8217;d like to hear some interesting things that get other writers motivated. I think that&#8217;s enough&#8230; Somehow I managed 1,705 words today!! I have no idea what&#8217;s happening anymore, but I&#8217;m very entertained.</p>

    <p>And my time. I actually have another hour because I&#8217;m going to see the oral surgeon today. I&#8217;m writing a paper for school and got three sentences typed thus far. It concerns me a bit, but I&#8217;m not behind, so that&#8217;s a plus.</p>

    <p>I hope that means everybody didn&#8217;t quit. I got my 25K badge tonight, and though I&#8217;m excited, I&#8217;m still only halfway. She has memory problems, so I don&#8217;t think she knows. I will not turn the Wizard into Malcolm Tucker. I&#8217;m ready for CH 15.</p>

    <p>I rastled almost 2k words out of my brain today, bringing my total to 19019. I keep forgetting I&#8217;m doing 3k a day instead of 2.5. Actually working out of my real office today. Thanks for helping me try.</p>

    <p>I should try to churn out 3k tomorrow as well so that I get ahead of the curve again. I wanted to finish early as well, but who knows? I HIT WORD COUNT! Sooo, 292 on THAT sprint, but I finished a scene and didn&#8217;t know how to start the next&#8230; Hope I can do a few more this evening.</p>

    <p>I like this book too much to leave it alone. I was too far into my WIP to try this year. I&#8217;ve got about an hour to write before bed so shooting for&#8230; I might just have to go for it and finish 50,000 by tomorrow. And so do I. In my grave.</p>

    <p>(do you think those 350 want to come to me. It was Michael and in my defense it&#8217;s been 70 pages. I&#8217;m at 25,783 so far. I was proud to represent District 5 at the Lust Game.</p>

    <p>Who wants to sprint with me? I&#8217;m nearly caught up. I made a dent today. I&#8217; ma go do the thing. Nein, because I&#8217;m German.</p>

    <p>which reminds me don&#8217;t forget to stretch between sprints!! I just had a really good idea for my novel but if I did it I would be forced to write a sequel. I guess that&#8217;s a sign I should be writing instead. I will write today! I&#8217;m rather stunned that I haven&#8217;t exhausted myself yet.</p>

    <p>If only Tormund Giantsbane were here to help me climb over it. But, the hangover is now receding just in time for me to make an early start on Day 16. I am DOING it! I really needed some me time tonight.</p>

    <p>I knew the Wizard would get me going! 6:36 am, can&#8217;t sleep even though this couch is super damn comfy, and just had a major idea come to me. I&#8217;m on a roll! Just wrote the scene that inspired my WIP while listening to the song that inspired my WIP. I think I&#8217;m ready to call this chapter done.</p>

    <p>I am 350 words off 30k! I might tear off a big chunk this weekend. I&#8217;ve just been so busy&#8230; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m getting much writing done today.</p>

    <p>I need coffee. As I said, names are TBD, so far I have Jane, Janet, John, Joe, Jamie, James, Jeremy, and Cadence. I can&#8217;t force any words to come out&#8230; And with that, I&#8217;m going to bed. I&#8217;ve finally hit a bit of a groove to my story, it&#8217;s getting exciting and stuff is happening.</p>

    <p>&quot; I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs&#8230; I broke 10K! Not even nearly there, but I&#8217;m optimistic. I&#8217;m just suffering from too much meh and ehhh.</p>

    <p>I hit my word count goal yesterday, and I&#8217;m on my way today. How have I forgotten how to do things in here? I&#8217;m at work, smiling and feel alive. I&#8217;m embarrassed to have so much real life in my novel.</p>

    <p>there is going to be a dog in my book? I hear the young people would say &quot;the struggle is real. Time to roll up my sleeves and dive back in. Don&#8217;t know why it took me so long to realise this, but writing goes a lot better and faster when you know what&#8217;s coming next.</p>

    <p>&quot; How was I supposed to process this? I started off just&#8217; building a busy day buffer&#8217;. Mom and dad are ushering me to log off. Gotta sit until my word count gets back on track. So far this month, it&#8217;s been much tougher to get my writing done on the weekends.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m ready to write some words. I doubt I could write professionally as the deadlines would turn me into a monster. Who&#8217;s writing with me? I have! I think I can do this thing&#8230;</p>

    <p>Who&#8217;s with me? &#8220; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! I swear I&#8217;m not ignoring Twitter, I&#8217;m just writing, working, or sleeping. Getting to my word count goal was so hard today, but I made it : D. Actually got in a couple things I liked. &#8221; I &#8220;counts just as much as&#8221; sesquipedalian &quot;.</p>

    <p>I just needed to talk the story out a bit. I feel an intense action scene with battle axes coming on. I&#8217;ll just have to keep going, then! I am both immensely proud and absurdly jealous.</p>

    <p>I really didn&#8217;t feel like writing, had to push myself. I&#8217;m gonna be the kind of slacker that dribbles in a few words here and there, then writes an entire novel in the last two weeks. Each day I decide if this is the day I take off. All but two of my characters disappeared last week and haven&#8217;t been seen or heard!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been painting and I slept in after no sleep in the hospital the night before. I don&#8217;t care. I might not get to 50000 by Dec, but if I can manage double figures by the end of tonight that&#8217;ll be something&#8230; Not that I&#8217;m anywhere near halfway done with my novel. I had so much to do.</p>

    <p>Hit 35k while I did it. Pretending it&#8217;s a snow day so I can stay inside and write! I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m getting much writing done today.</p>

    <p>I just wrote 5k words in 1 hour 45 minutes. San Francisco, I am in you! Who thinks I am capable of bullshitting 9.5K of words today without any actual plot to work on? I think i took on too much this month.</p>

    <p>I am writing so much every day that the November dates seem to creep forward. Sometimes I look at this outline and think &quot;you people are going to hate me for this in the best way. Join me if you want! Dun dun duuuunnnnnnn I currently have 38,600 words!</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s that time of year when I am always either checking my twitter, eating candy, or writing. Listening to my daughter play clarinet and procrastinating. I didn&#8217;t plan it that way, but it&#8217;s that way so far. And I&#8217;m ready to walk out the door to church.</p>

    <p>Basically I&#8217;m writing about writing. Now I feel like I should just keep writing anyway but I need to be up early tomorrow&#8230; 1,841 words written today, giving me a total of 23,231. &quot; How fast do I have to run?</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll fix it to fit later. I&#8217;m at work, smiling and feel alive. 2,317 words of the 3,000 I had wanted today. When I don&#8217;t want to write, I make myself write anyway. My eyes may fall out of my head in my sleep.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m ready to write some words. I&#8217;ve dragged myself up to 10,500 words which isn&#8217;t great but beginning to warm to it now. Couldn&#8217;t have done that if I&#8217;d tried. I have fleece pants, two dogs, and 400wds to the halfway mark.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m either working or wanting to nap this month it seems. Well, so far I&#8217;ve done 1,869 words and I&#8217;ve got to stop to get ready for work. 30K is begging for me to make it. I just breathed new life into my story by giving it a new one!</p>

    <p>Guess I&#8217;m writing in silence. I&#8217;m at 2,609 for the day. Slowly but surely I&#8217;m getting there. I&#8217;ve really found my groove.</p>

    <p>But it burns me out even when muse is in a frenzy. Until later :) I&#8217;m going to procrastinate a little. I caught up on a lot of paperwork at work. I&#8217;m now at 26,868 words. To get my word count in for today (and go a little over), I drank 2 cups of coffee which is 2 more than normal.</p>

    <p>I really want to make a map of my city in To Look Skyward. And I have to get up ridiculously early tomorrow. Today, I am putting some chains on it in hopes I can pull it out. RS : And I&#8217;ll post them here so you can all see. I have been studying death whilst feeling like death for days.</p>

    <p>I haven&#8217;t written much today. I just printed out my novel so far. Because I cut myself and had to bleed. I&#8217;m in a shame spiral with my writing today. I blame you.</p>

    <p>I just reached 30000 words. On second though, I think I&#8217;m going to write just a little more and take a nap. &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! Have I atoned for not writing much this week?</p>

    <p>&#8230;well now I&#8217;m not at 40k anymore, that didn&#8217;t work out the way I thought it would! 956 words to go until I am completely caught up. So close I can taste it! I was ready to confront the Sky Kraken.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll check it out. But the responsible part of me says I should write words. I am never missing this again. Though I admit, I&#8217;m in need of a shower, which I hope to do when I get up tomorrow, before I write on my project! Woke up in my office chair. Sometimes I feel like the only thing I&#8217;m good at is pushing through on difficult writing days. It&#8217;s been harder to make time this week but I did make sure to write something each day.</p>

    <p>I know I&#8217;m not going to make 1667 today. 25k here I come.. I think I might be writing a short story right now, possible novella. I did not accomplish as much homework as I wish I would have.</p>

    <p>Yay me! I wrote 4,260 words today! I&#8217;m 499 little words away from having 15,000 and it&#8217;s more than I thought I&#8217;d have at this point.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve just finished the sentence started yesterday. I wanted to get a little more ahead today, but it was not in the stars&#8230;</p>

    <p>I really need someone to bring me a Peppermint Mocha from Starbucks. I will have a girl run off to SF my heroes nearly run off the road on the way to Santa Cruz. Argh. Not going to make my word count goal for the night. Par here I come. I wonder if I can get to 40k tonight.</p>

    <p>Will I try? Ugh, so far for the night, i&#8217;ve cleared about 3 thousand words worth of my obstacle. My desire to edit is getting in the way of my desire to write&#8230; I BELIEVE. I really want to read a book instead of write one, just for a night&#8230;</p>

    <p>Won&#8217;t try to annoy you guys too much with reminders of my contest. I&#8217;m thinking of keeping word count challenges year round for friendly competition. I wrote over 4k words today. And I need to write 5K today to get back on track&#8230;</p>

    <p>Suddenly, I feel like I can reach my protagonist. It&#8217;s just now occurring to me that I should have planned the timeline of my plot a little better. I&#8217;ll be on for the next 40 mins. I&#8217;ll be starting my first 5k word sprint in about 10 minutes!</p>

    <p>Had to meet my word quota for today and I did. 2,213 words so far today, bringing me to 27,677. I wrote 8924 words on Day 12! I think my hand is going to fall off. Thought I only had 24K words but really am at 28K!!</p>

    <p>Not looking forward to one that I know takes place later on. I&#8217;ve got chips, I&#8217;ve got salsa, I&#8217;ve got wayyy too much peppermint mocha&#8230; No snow day for me&#8230; I need coffee. I hit 45,000 words on the train, but I am fading fast.</p>

    <p>353 words left to achieve my&#8217; official&#8217; target&#8230; I only wrote 1,087. My male MC just told my female MC that his grandmother is Lady Luck. So far, I&#8217;m plugging along at 34,511 words. Where has this been my whole life?</p>

    <p>that&#8217;s a wrap for today, my friends! I&#8217;m surprised my face isn&#8217;t burning. The thing I like about daily writing is the intensity of your story consuming your thoughts. Feel like I&#8217;m really making progress today.</p>

    <p>I wish I was a discovery writer. So with tears in my eyes and Blackbird in my head I&#8217;m going to write. &#8220; He texted : &#8221;Love you to&#8220; So I sent : &#8221;Too&quot; Seriously, I couldn&#8217;t help it. I guess that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to write every day, so I know where I left off at.</p>

    <p>Need to play catch up today in order to make it to my goal. Now as soon as I write 1,000 words, I can get some. Anybody want to tell me what burnt skin smells like? &quot; And besides, if I were there when she came back out, she would have certainly started asking questions. Now how to get from one scene to the scene I eventually really need to be at&#8230;</p>

    <p>forgot that I&#8217;ve written so much today bc I&#8217;ve been squeezing in bits in pieces all day. Getting closer to my 3k goal for tonight. Just saw my Word document hit 20,000!</p>

    <p>And yes, dear reader, I did take a look through the pages and had a peek into your soul. still behind but I&#8217;m catching up. Then I figured out how I could fit this with an earlier plot bunny about finding a lost dog and it just works. So I&#8217;m doing something to try to sort it out. I have about 20 000 words, which is still slightly behind, but not terrible. Writing at a more relaxed pace for now so that my mind can wander a little bit.</p>

    <p>So much writing to do, but do I get a day off soon. And me, I&#8217;m going to study. Monday I shall conquer!</p>

    <p>Now I get to go do some yoga and catch up on Agents of Shield! Cause I&#8217;m young and I got story arc issues and my pacing&#8217;s real slow&#8230;do I look like a mind reader sir? I have to catch back up today. But that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to give up.</p>

    <p>I will not rest until I hit 20K. I&#8217;m going for 40k by the end of the weekend. Can I make a request that every time I open a new bottle of red, 1000 words magically get added up?</p>

    <p>I finally figured out where my novel is going! The Packers won and I just had a burst of energy, busting through 30,000 words. Finally hit my daily word count goal for this first time this month. When I acquired this bacteria that took up real estate in my respiratory system, I simultaneously lost ALL motivation.</p>

    <p>can I leave the EoSR with 25k? Conceivably, I could do 100K at this rate. Almost to the halfway mark on my word count! Fourteen days and 21,846 words in and the story has changed so much since I planned it.</p>

    <p>Bit much for my series for what to call &#8220;kitten&#8221; anymore. But I&#8217;m going to, because I&#8217;m a fucking professional. Need to get my butt in gear to reach 25,000 tomorrow!!! I can haz GPS? Let&#8217;s add on to my word count at 20 after 4 in the morning.</p>

    <p>Was about to fall asleep when a really important plot point in my novel finally came together. I never had &#8220;Siri&#8221; before on my old phone! Early morning start on my only day off. Of course, I have yet to write the middle&#8230; However, I will also read&#8230; Also, in case you were wondering, my current noveling music is Backstreet Boys&#8230;</p>

    <p>I literally have a Token White Male. Tomorrow I can work on my outline. I wasn&#8217;t expecting to hit this major event so early. I&#8217;ve spent most of my day hiding in Mom&#8217;s room with my laptop doing so much writing.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll probably get to 10k before it&#8217;s over. I just wrote a scene that I KNOW will get completely cut out during the revisions. I won&#8217;t let the 2nd week slog prevail! Guess that means I&#8217;ve earned the right to log on for WoW tonight!</p>

    <p>hey, remember that time I wrote a novel? &quot; Maybe it&#8217;s the old Purloined Letter trick daring us to spot it like saying are you on my same brainwave? This isn&#8217;t great, but with exams and such, I&#8217;m pretty proud to have hit 10k words. I&#8217;m a maniac. I have a lot of work to catch up on! I&#8217;m barely at 24k today. And my heroine is just starting to figure out that her sainted mother is actually a super bitch.</p>

    <p>I regret nothing! AND my MC is embracing her truly epic self. I&#8217;m going to play with some plotbunnies instead. No words so far today, but my garage has a floor for the first time in years!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m not worried though. I still have a lot of story left to write. Good thing I got ahead yesterday, sick husband today so I didn&#8217;t get much writing done! aaaand my main character has been stabbed by an umbrella!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m back on track! I am a masochist. Here we go my Wordlings. but then again it is 03:19(am) here, I don&#8217;t know if that makes it better or worse than your situation. To be clear I&#8217;m not finished the story yet I just reached 50k! If I keep this pace up, I&#8217;ll certainly make 50,000 words by the 31st.</p>

    <p>Blog post to come, but I will not ensure its quality! I have one almost complete shirt and one almost complete pencil skirt. Maybe I can do it? I regret nothing. I&#8217;m still above the Total Word Count Goal for today, so I&#8217;m not TOO worried (mostly because I am soooo sleepy.</p>

    <p>sitting here with my headphones on and my family members are making faces at me. After one hour of constant writing, I feel like my word count is actually going backwards. I hope the second half goes as smoothly. I hear it&#8217;s super busy.</p>

    <p>Super early morning writing with tea by my side. It&#8217;s really a miracle that I&#8217;ve lasted this long. 15 minutes left and I&#8217;ve only written about 700 words!! I probably should have started writing today before now.</p>

    <p>I am writing a masterpiece. Any writers want to sprint with me now? Few more minutes, then I&#8217;ll get ready to leave.</p>

    <p>I predict severe overcaffeination today. I&#8217;ve got a midway goal to meet! Glad I hit the wall with a high count and sixteen days left.</p>

    <p>Yeah I&#8217;m gonna write me some pirates. I dunno that I&#8217;m a pure math class sees me outside the art of&#8230; &#8220; &#8221;Nothing, my dear Frodo. The ones on my head, not my face. Only 1,205 words written today (though it&#8217;s better than 0), putting me at a total of 26,255.</p>

    <p>Just hit 24,000 on my WIP. I hope this is not a harbinger for today&#8217;s word count. It was only a matter of time before I started questioning whether or not I&#8217;m really a writer and if fiction is worthy pursuit. Okay, I&#8217;ve been super distracted this morning but I&#8217;m going to attempt to write for half an hour then head to work.</p>

    <p>I think it&#8217;s doable. I&#8217;ve hit the halfway mark! And, that&#8217;s all my head can take today. I wrote NOTHING. I don&#8217;t mean to alarm anyone, but I reached 50k at 6:50am mountain standard time. In order to finish this book on my birthday, my new per day word goal is 2.4k. 79 full pages I smiled&#8230;because I&#8217;ve never gotten this far..</p>

    <p>Or as close to that as I can get, anyway. What I am doing : calling HMRC about expenses. I should bake cookies. Words are starting to flow out more easily, though I just hit a particularly sad turning point for MC. Good result considering how I couldn&#8217;t write the past two days.</p>

    <p>I love it when everything lines up and you get little hints from the universe that you are on the right path! Not bad considering I had to get up a few times because of kids and cats messing with things. I did it! Guns and fcking Roses is currently blasting on my theater.</p>

    <p>Alright I&#8217;m going to shower, and then write towards 25,000 words!! Words are starting to flow out more easily, though I just hit a particularly sad turning point for MC. I can go to bed in peace. After 2 pm my brain is pretty much like writing?</p>

    <p>Countdown to thanksgiving break means thinking about how to get my wordcount to 50,000. Thinking I should be writing. Yea, though I work through the rough first draft, I will fear no trolling, for words are with me. Yeaaaah, Madame Barista, I&#8217;m TOTALLY, DEFINITELY FOR SURE giving this second, free Starbucks drink to a friend.</p>

    <p>Yes still need to focus on my 1600 words today. Why yes, I did just teach myself to blow smoke rings for writing research. who&#8217;s up for joining me for a 25min sprint starting at : 20? I&#8217;m a bit behind but still writing :) I will not be discouraged even with a very busy weekend ahead. Slightly below my goal, but that just about 3 times as many words as yesterday!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m now writing monologues. Finished my novel, starting a new one from almost scratch! For some reason, I&#8217;m ready to wrap up the whole novel by 40k. if I get to 1000 words I will thank the writing gods. &#8217; It took me far too long to figure out why Microsoft Word had it underlined&#8230; Only 2K more to go to reach my daily goal!</p>

    <p>So there is a large surreal moon in my story. So my new reward is I only get to play it after I get my word count goal done for the day. I&#8217;ve stopped. I&#8217;ve got this.</p>

    <p>So close I need to make sure I don&#8217;t go too fast or miss anything big. Still nowhere near the actual point of the novel and I can&#8217;t even begin to explain how unexpected I find this. I figured out the problem!! Going back to the editing I was doing.</p>

    <p>I need a sprint partner to keep me motivated! I can make that up, though, yes? The only good part about it snowing outside is that it is also snowing in my story and my MC is contemplating it.</p>

    <p>Last year I had to write 8K words on the November 30th. I&#8217;m havinf a week two struggle mostly thanks to my work schedule but next week I&#8217;m off for 8 days so I should be able to finish. I must follow! My husband is out of town and I can write to my hearts content. Totally stuck on how to start this chapter and I&#8217;ve only written 300 words today, so I gotta get a move on. I spent a day happy dancing, then went back to the keyboard.</p>

    <p>Only wrote about 700 words today, but I was really excited about those 700! Tell me how far you&#8217;ve come! I hate it so much when main characters get just dreadful,which is why I feel like I actually love my main character tbh. I just wrote 6,000 words today, and I&#8217;m still not caught up! Feel like I&#8217;m going backwards. Need to hurry my ass up&#8230;</p>

    <p>Now I&#8217;m mobile!! One thing that keeps me from writing, The Sims. I could get a lot done in 2.5 hours. Have decided to drink some water, since all I have had is coffee so far&#8230; I&#8217;m really struggling right now.</p>

    <p>I like writing stories about women. I hope so. I had several ideas for new scenes an hour ago!&#8230;Now, what were they?&#8230; Must complete 10k before my birthday at midnight!!!!</p>

    <p>I am going to spend today through Sunday having 5k word sprints. I am pleasantly surprised. Must take a break from sprints to put something in my belly. But I can do this!! Wait, did I just decide to amputate my main character&#8217;a leg?</p>

    <p>I haven&#8217;t written any more words since the last word count update? Things I&#8217;m good at writing : dialogue, descriptions of weird things, the middle bits of stories. I&#8217;m hoping tons and tons? Day 12 : Beginning to suspect outline doesn&#8217;t possess 50k words of material, I&#8217;ll have to start describing stuff.</p>

    <p>That&#8217;s all I ask. I am officially over halfway to the end of my goal! I&#8217;m now at 14k. I can manage 1000 words a day, but for some reason, more than that really starts to drag me down. 28k mark :) Reaching that next thousand pumps me up every time!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve crossed the 19k mark!!!! I think I was typing too fast. I had a habbit of skipping a set up. Holy shnikes, an even 43k in my master file. he gave me nightmares with Christine and paranoid about cars, haha!</p>

    <p>Think I&#8217;ll take the rest of the night off and rest up for a big weekend push. Thanks for link, will take a closer look as soon as I&#8217;ve completed my 50,000 words for November. Wish me luck! I should check on some possible promoting options then write. Not my best in terms of daily word count but I&#8217;m finally getting my groove back.</p>

    <p>5 more lines left to write then I have to count my words up. Still on track and I think I have the major plot points worked out to the end. I hope&#8230; &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days!</p>

    <p>Think I can make it to 40K before I go to bed Sunday night? I thought it was backed up! The MOST far behind I&#8217;ve EVER been&#8230; I no longer the Knights of NaNoWriMo is overly pretty, the slavers are a pantser&#8217;s plo&#8230;</p>

    <p>I mention a subreddit in my novel, too. For the 1st time since Nov 1, I did NOT write yesterday. But the words amuse me! I&#8217;m around 23K, not as far as I&#8217;d like, but family has been keeping me busy this week. I&#8217;m all caught up for the first time in about a week.</p>

    <p>A winner is me! 13,800 words in, I throw my main character out a window. Hopefully, I can keep it up after today. Having my nails painted seems to make writing more fun when it gets slow.</p>

    <p>I am definitely starting to feel that week 2 block. Can I reach 14,000 today? What does that say about me? I&#8217;ve never came this far before, i&#8217;m freaking out. Cthulhu help me when I have to edit this first draft&#8230;</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve just been attacked by a rogue story idea! Do I use narration or dialogue? I&#8217;m halfway through this book, and the major plot hasn&#8217;t even happened yet. Dropped my first Jane Eyre reference 21,000 words in.</p>

    <p>Welp, I&#8217;ve fallen back in love with my story. I&#8217;m writing a whole section of my book that I have no idea if it will make the final cut but whatever. Take my hand and we&#8217;ll make it I swear&#8230; If so, I&#8217;m Princess Alethea. Now I&#8217;m back on track.</p>

    <p>Argh. Up to 19,039 words and I just want to sleeeeep. I think I&#8217;ll try topping 30K after sunrise. I need some cheerleaders! Maybe I&#8217;ll have a new story ready in time for next year&#8217; s. Ready for my writing day tomorrow!</p>

    <p>I am. Aw man, I&#8217;ve never been so far below that line and still pulled it off before. I just might make it halfway today. Oh please, imagination, don&#8217;t fail me now.</p>

    <p>About to listen to some Queen and work on my novel. I have great ideas but actually pulling the words out is killing me slowly&#8230; I am SOOO close to 50k. I just killed off a main character, something I have never done before.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m worried that my excitement for writing has tied itself to the Spurs season. Hubby came home from work early so I could write. Come on, dammit, I&#8217;m playing catch up here! Pretty sure I just passed the 23k mark with that last sprint.</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t know how I did it.. I really need to get up earlier or something to get a jumpstart on this. I&#8217;ve written 2.5k but ride isn&#8217;t here yet. &quot; Well, my love, now you&#8217;ll taste the privileges of being a White!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m hardcore slacking. I passed the 25,000 word mark today on my MG comedy. And yes I&#8217;m supposed to be writing instead&#8230; I&#8217;m still behind but am a lot closer to winning now! Also, I really want to share Part 2 of my story with you!</p>

    <p>I could write 500 words and hit 45k, or I could shower and start planning my next novel&#8230; Alright I&#8217;m on a push for the next two hours. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll do any more, but I&#8217;m slowly getting caught up! But I was determined to stick with 3rd no matter how many times it got away&#8230;</p>

    <p>I did not want to write today. But I&#8217;m ready to go again. I HAVE TO write tomorrow! Do I have to go to the Gala for work tonight? Oh, man, I just noticed my first plot hole&#8230;</p>

    <p>Really didn&#8217;t want to write tonight, but my goal has been to stay ahead! I&#8217;ve written nearly a thousand words so far today. Hoping to get my last 10k done on Sunday. Way to close the gap me. Been nesting at my desk.</p>

    <p>Almost done with my first story. I need at least 3 more days like today to catch up. Mapping out chapters instead of just seeing where the story takes me. can the rest of my life stop now so i can finish this&#8230;? Hit my personal NaNo goal!</p>

    <p>That&#8217;s exactly what my story needs. I got 2 new games for this. I just instantly knew who my character would be played by in a movie Wow. I am DOING it! Hurts my elbows. After days of not making time to write I&#8217;m shutting out the world today to write. Send me your word counts and Hogwarts house!</p>

    <p>I have sparkling water to chase away the sleepy eyes. You think I should go for 22k before I go off for tonight? Will be looking for a few sets of eyes to beta read the first chapter of my novella soon! I&#8217;m going to take a break first.</p>

    <p>I added 6,425 words today after writing nothing for 5 days straight! Apparently, I can type 2000 words an hour. Managed to write my amount of words for both thursday and friday. I got this.</p>

    <p>I had a whole folder in Scrivener not being counted! I have zero focus and zero willpower apparently. I&#8217;ve got 20K and 10 chapters. I have an hour then I gotta record the listening test.</p>

    <p>I am starting to love what I am writing, but unearthing all this is making me crave talk therapy&#8230;or whiskey. I think my main character just fell in love with the wrong person. I HIT 25K WORDS!!! &quot; I think, therefore&#8230;</p>

    <p>I think I&#8217;m done with writing for tonight. Okay, back to pushing myself in my writing for my last 2 hours tonight&#8230; I see the end in sight! Makes me glad I added a 2nd blanket to my bed last week!</p>

    <p>May write more later if the mood takes me. This year I have 1 who is a complete mystery. Just me? I wish my derriere was big so I didn&#8217;t have to work on my novel. I can do this&#8230;</p>

    <p>my simplified character and conflict formula : what does he want? I&#8217;ve written 6K today and am NOT stopping until I hit 40K. I named two completely separate characters the same thing. Starting on 23280, so let&#8217;s see how many words I can write today.</p>

    <p>skipping a scene that I probably shouldn&#8217;t. I vowed to never use&#8217; ephemeral&#8217; after a particular episode of Teen Wolf, yet I finally found the right place for it. I need words. I can&#8217;t reach my word count! I like making my main character do chores.</p>

    <p>I made it! I&#8217;M NOT, I WON&#8217;T! That was a nice little groove I got into. I shot my protagonist in the face and I still don&#8217;t know where to go. I hope so. Now, if only I had artistic talent&#8230;</p>

    <p>Today should be the day, though, when I hit 50K! I have lost my damn mind. I thought this would be a Middle Grade fantasy but I might end up making it an adult one. That&#8217;s exactly what my story needs.</p>

    <p>I just need Two. Maybe I should start killing characters. Alright muse, I&#8217;m gonna need you to cooperate. I think i going to step away for a hotel. Just barely made my 1k word goal today. But today I broke through to new inspiration. For the first time in a while, I&#8217;m in the word count range I need to be in.</p>

    <p>Scraped together some time this afternoon to write and hit my daily goal! So I know what to do with Luke. I was really getting into it, too!</p>

    <p>Already hit my word count for the day, but I&#8217;m on a roll. Wrote 5,000 more today which means I only have like 15k left to write! Wish me luck. I just realized I don&#8217;t have a main goal for my main character and I&#8217;m 27k words in.</p>

    <p>If my characters can beat the odds just in time then so can I! I have to, there is no other option. I think I&#8217;m hitting a major turning point in my story :) Are you liking yours so far? I&#8217;m starting to think I might actually finish this thing. Have written over 5k words to get up to 26.6k and I dont think they&#8217;re too shabby either. Mainly because I lost time this morning going to the dentist.</p>

    <p>Maybe I will finish on time. Not as many today because I had to have actual human interaction. I WILL arise at 5am tomorrow to get in an hour of writing before work. Why is it more difficult to write at weekends when I have more time?</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Ok so I didn&#8217;t quite make it to 25000 last night, fell asleep at 3am! I&#8217;m apparently scaring away followers again. I told you I would catch up! Writing all by my lonesome this evening.</dt>

        <dd>) I&#8217;m currently working on Snow. Have i finally managed to get out of my slump and go towards the action? I have a lot of work to do. I&#8217;m only up to 7,800 words.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>5K in four hours might be a stretch, but I&#8217;m going to try. Scrapped my whole novel and I&#8217;m already celebrating the new draft. I KNEW I SHOULD&#8217;VE STOPPED EDITING! But It&#8217;s a whole new chapter and I should leave it until tomorrow.</p>

    <p>hey I havn&#8217;t had the time to tweet, I have been with my novel. Writers&#8217; block feels like sitting in the dentist&#8217;s chair, a drill whirring in the back of my mind. After a couple of days of not writing thanks to my new job, I&#8217;m aiming for 26,000 words today.</p>

    <p>Finished my first NaNo story at 40,851 words. why do I suddenly have the maturity level of an eight year old? Well it&#8217;s finally happened, as I knew it would. I meant 5,747!</p>

    <p>I thought about stuff I needed to add to my book while I was sleeping. I have 39k so far. I somehow managed to reach my word count for today after getting no sleep last night and running around all day. Who&#8217;s with me? I just decided I&#8217;m gonna be destroying a character by the end of this book and I&#8217;m super excited to do this.</p>

    <p>I need rest, the spririt is willing, but my hands are spongy and bruised. It&#8217;s very or there, and I&#8217;m curious to see how people take it. I&#8217;m so sleepy. After that&#8230;final exams get at me!</p>

    <p>Only 519 words for yesterday and I find : I&#8217;m ok with this. I am as well but my girls have me busy. 4 minutes to midnight and I hit the 1,700 word count for today! I got over the 25k mark!!! So one of my characters, who is already in a relationship, is sorta flirting with another character.</p>

    <p>I got my word count up to 8,733. I&#8217;ll have a lot more late nights to come for this book. I am going to study for a while as I contemplate the next steps. I want to do more today, but I need to think about what&#8217;s next first.</p>

    <p>I needed it. I&#8217;m about par. Tony had to run to a cottage and met a new character that I didn&#8217;t even know existed!</p>

    <p>I am closing the window and getting to work. Around 4500 words in the race to catch up, and feel I&#8217;m creeping closer&#8230;but not today. Thanks to that monster 30 minute sprint I&#8217;m over halfway to 50k!</p>

    <p>I just spelled &#8220;exasperatedly&#8221; correctly on the first try. I have 5k words so far. 8,000 a day isn&#8217;t unattainable if I just do nothing but write. Omg. I cannot write in this weather. I am DOING it!</p>

    <p>I did it I reached 50k! I wanted to hit 40k today, but decided to socialize. And apparently the iPad doesn&#8217;t want me to write. Going to take a break to watch my favorite YouTube stuff, then back at it.</p>

    <p>Day 15 and I have written 23&#8217;584 words for NaNoWriMo! I bought a new pipe too! I WON!! I already finished my 50K word first draft of my novel&#8230;2 weeks early.</p>

    <p>And that&#8217;s what I do. I am feeling particularly clever tonight. I did it. Well now that the big wurm has attacked, I need a cool way for our heroes to defeat it&#8230;</p>

    <p>I WILL make 50,000 by Sept 30. &#8220; &#8221;Nothing, my dear Frodo. For me, writing nirvana exists somewhere between 3 and 4 glasses of wine. 22,550 for my word count so far. instead I&#8217;ve got to focus on the first book, SIGH.</p>

    <p>Just thought I&#8217;d hit my first 1,000 words for the day. &quot; If there&#8217;s a God, I pray he forgives us for this war. I know the goal for today is over 21k, but I&#8217;m chuffed that I finally reached 10k!</p>

    <p>I will push out these words before bed, I will. Not that I&#8217;m anywhere near halfway done with my novel. I&#8217;d like to have a 10k weekend. Or is that just me? I&#8217;m back up to date, and I could do more but real life is calling me back!</p>

    <p>I should be around 23k today but I&#8217;m stuck on 21.6k. I don&#8217;t know if I can finish this. Apparently my two MCs. Only like 2K more of writing and I am DONEEEE.</p>

    <p>I passed the 20,000 word mark. Not that I&#8217;m anywhere near halfway done with my novel. I&#8217;ve gota feeling&#8230; Didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d get much writing done on vacation in Florida, but I just hit 30,000 words!</p>

    <p>I was on a writing roll then I stopped for lunch and now I&#8217;m stuck again : A novel by me. I&#8217;ve been given a word count target of 2500 this evening. I wrote 1300 words on my phone. Somehow I&#8217;m already 607 words away from hitting 15k. And now that I&#8217;ve got the world fully set up it&#8217;s just making all the main action happen. If you&#8217;re stumped, ask yourself,&#8217; What inspired me in the first place?</p>

    <p>I just booked a dental appt for 7AM SATURDAY. Works for me. Was hoping for about 1500 more, but alas I could not pull it from me today. I&#8217;m determined to write my first 1000 words for today before I go to sleep.</p>

    <p>935 words tonight and I feel so done. Not that I&#8217;m anywhere near halfway done with my novel. Tomorrow I shall start anew! I was just on a site with&#8217; funny pictures&#8217; in the domain name.</p>

    <p>I sure hope we both end up at the same spot. It just figures that now I&#8217;d be struck with an idea for a new book. Yes, I&#8217;m running behind, but I&#8217;ve a chunk of free time tomorrow! I need to get on it! I&#8217;ve got some days to make up for. I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s a swimming break time and then back to hit that 37k or possibly 38k. I have a feeling a lot of this backstory will be edited out&#8230;next month, when I do a rewrite.</p>

    <p>None of my writing buddies are getting together tonight&#8230; Halfway through November, you count your words, and I forget to write mine, 25,000 seems so far away. I&#8217;m halfway to 50k! but I&#8217;m so close to being all caught up. Funny thing is, still have that skip day from early on that I didn&#8217;t skip.</p>

    <p>Only wrote 500 today BUT I did write. I&#8217;d get more words in if I didn&#8217;t insist on handwriting everything down initially. I WANT TO SEE THOSE WORD COUNTS FLYYYYY! I&#8217;m ready!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m very interrested to see what you&#8217;ve been writting about! I did it early on but never got an email or anything. Enough problems for me tonight, that&#8217;s all folks. Writing meant everything to me back then : l. Then I have a buffer if I start lagging during the week.</p>

    <p>I passed 40,000 words last night. I fear I may be procrastinating&#8230; Question : would changing my reward threshold to 500 words be better or worse motivation than 1000? 300 more words to hit minimum count for my next day.</p>

    <p>Finally, I got to write about something exploding! Shake them fingers and toss me those counts. If I focus for a couple of hours, I can do it. The goal today is to get to 35k, and it seems much more attainable when I break it down into smaller sessions. My novel is meandering because I can&#8217;t create the plot as fast as I can type!</p>

    <p>Any of my writing buddies writing today? Much like me! Let&#8217;s see if I can hit the halfway mark today! I feel like I&#8217;ve hit a brick wall&#8230; Speaking of discipline, I wrote a grand total of 53 words today.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve got stuff to take care of today. let&#8217;s just say I need to get writing! I got my 25,000 words badge. Not quite as much as I&#8217;d wanted, but DAMN WELL CLOSE ENOUGH FUCKITY BYE. Almost to the Pivotal Scene that spurs my third act.</p>

    <p>So what did I do? Would I be pushing it if I hoped to reach 15,000 by tonight? Can I get a WHOOP! I feel torn between trying to get another 1000 or going out to have beer and scotch. So far : over 28k of 50k words written in my new novel! the abuse Winter hurls at herself during her anxiety attack is almost exactly what I say to myself during mine&#8230;</p>

    <p>This is my&#8217; get ready&#8217; tweet cuz tweeting costs me a minute of my life! I love when I throw random crap into a story and think OH MY GOD I&#8217;M A GENIUS because it&#8217;s suddenly perfect. Not what I was hoping for. I don&#8217;t want to do anything else.</p>

    <p>I got this! I&#8217;m pretty sure 1500 words in less than an hour is a new record for me. I put yellow Do Not Cross police tape around today. Yeah it&#8217;s pretty clear, I&#8217;m just on page 2, but I can write it, write it&#8230;like I&#8217;m supposed to do&#8230;</p>

    <p>But a break for now I think. I didnt quite reach my 6k words goal for today but 5600 is pretty close. I&#8217;m off to attack my WIP with a vengeance! 8,000 words into my 10,000 word sprint for the day. Thank you very much constipation advert, ruining my train of thought in my chapter.</p>

    <p>I will not turn the Wizard into Malcolm Tucker. Is it just me or are these revisions taking FOREVER to get through?? Going to try to break 30k before I head to bed. Even though I have to be up early, I think I&#8217;ll keep writing. I&#8217;d love to go back to bed right now, but, you know, this novel won&#8217;t write itself.</p>

    <p>Word goal : 3500 before I sleep. I have an hour and forty minutes left before having to get ready for work. I&#8217;m thinking 5,000 words today? &#8230;But then this whole 2014 has been about rebuilding my discipline and getting out of my own head and back onto the page&#8230;</p>

    <p>So glad I&#8217;m working on a very short book right now. Well, kind of, since I&#8217;m still behind! Spinning Santaur is going to visit me in my dreams tonight. tore my excerpt to pieces.</p>

    <p>I know you can hit goal. I broke 25K! I&#8217;m way behind but glad I took the time I needed. Though good news, I&#8217;m over the half way point if I wanted to go for 250K.</p>

    <p>Got my tea, my laptop, and my chocolate. that means I get an evening off to watch QI yes? Not of writing, just tired and wish I had more time. Also happy to report that I FINALLY broke 10,000 words last night!</p>

    <p>I know next to nothing about Facebook, so imagine my joy when it suddenly became a feature in my novel. Wanted to be farther along, but I guess for a daily total of over 3.5K I can live. Now I&#8217;m googling if the strip club, Jilly&#8217; s, was opened in Toronto in the 1960s. I need alcohol.</p>

    <p>Today&#8217;s &#8220;Word I couldn&#8217;t spell right on the first try&#8221; : &quot;Ecstasy. I am DOING it! I am DOING it!</p>

    <p>BTW, I&#8217;m at 21,285 words. I&#8217;m excited, I think I&#8217;m finally understanding one of my main characters. I have a sign on my door that saws&#8217; quiet please novel in progress&#8217; but does anyone listen? Writing deadline looming, but I had this sudden urge to clean off my desk.</p>

    <p>&quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! Why do I let myself get so far behing? I have no clue. I hate MOST of my first drafts, so its always nice to write a sentence that makes me happy.</p>

    <h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>Finally, I got to write about something exploding! Redoubling my writing efforts tomorrow. I CAN MAKE THAT UP. Never thought myself a writer until I started writing. But I don&#8217;t want to do the writing part. I have my tea back! On track to break my goal of 100,000 words this month.</p>

    <p>Question : why isn&#8217;t my novel writing itself? All set up to write with the SQUID OF DESTINY and my Nebula bobblehead. I&#8217;m so sleepy but I continue to write&#8230; Wrote 532wds on the bus on my way to work today!</p>

    <p>Ending tonight with 28.2k words, so close to 30k that I can almost taste it. But how would I know since I don&#8217;t have time to read it? I have a novel to write!! I&#8217;m getting a lot of&#8217; feels&#8217;.</p>

    <p>Ooo my beta reading has been brought forward. I only plotted one chapter of Book 3. I can&#8217;t believe it. I&#8217;m shooting for 3K today.</p>

    <p>I cleaned three houses today&#8230;for my day job and still managed to meet my daily word goal of 1667 words. I think you&#8217;ve just invented a &quot;thing. I already can&#8217;t wait to edit it. Now&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

    <p>My novel just turned into a thriller like I wanted, but couldn&#8217;t manage! So, since 20,004 is my goal for today, I&#8217;m caught up!! But I don&#8217;t want to be panicking last minute.. Ordered numbers are my downfall. Almost 9k now, should I make it to 10k before I sleep?</p>

    <p>Let my characters share my misery. San Francisco here I come! I will not let the virus get the upper hand until I got there. Off to get my word count in! Worked for Sidney Sheldon, who I am paraphrasing.</p>

    <p>As if I was going through the motions. I am a quitter. Going to end up relying on Thanksgiving leftovers to power me through at the end. I wrote 5006 words today.</p>

    <p>I couldn&#8217;t concentrate on writing so I thought COFFEE but now I think it was because I was already too hyper&#8230; I can&#8217;t believe it! By the time I reach today&#8217;s goal I&#8217;ll be on the floor.</p>

    <p>I am going to spend all of NaNoWriMo editing. Wish me luck! I&#8217;m at 24004 words and I&#8217;m grateful. Ended my day at 2358.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve already won over 5K words, plus I&#8217;m honing my writing discipline. I had a 5K day. I am DOING it! Wish me luck! I hope everyone has a productive day!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve written myself into a corner again. I&#8217;m at 17,666 words when I should be at 23,333. I was on a writing roll then I stopped for lunch and now I&#8217;m stuck again : A novel by me. My story has been on my mind all afternoon!</p>

    <p>I might just have to go for it and finish 50,000 by tomorrow. Determined to get 2,000 words before I have to go out tonight. I keep losing my am writing session. I am DOING it! Wish me luck!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m outta here! I&#8217;m gonna try for 5,000 words today. I didn&#8217;t hit 25K today. I&#8217;m going to write like a maniac tonight. I managed to get my word count up to date 5mins before midnight.</p>

    <p>I always burn them while I&#8217;m writing and now I&#8217;m almost out. I&#8217;m not ashamed of my low sprint count! I&#8217;m officially jumping around to different scenes in my novel. Was aiming for 1100 in 30 minutes as part of a challenge I&#8217;m following.</p>

    <p>For every 1k words I write, I seem to be gaining a lb in weight! I said I couldn&#8217;t break 100,000 this weekend but it is looking feasible!! I wrote 168 words in the bit of time I carved out today. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to finish the scene before I have to leave. Think I can do it?</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve nicknamed my two MMCs asshole and sasshole. I&#8217;ll try to get chapter 8 done tomorrow. There was a scene I expected to write two days ago, and nearly 4,000 words later I still haven&#8217;t got to it. or I guess their body count? I needs da words. Why do I even try? puts me at 2K for the day.</p>

    <p>FOUR WEDDINGS has given me an idea for a scene. And it only took 3 hours (not counting the time I tried to write this morning!) I wanted to include champagne in the historical side of this but I wasn&#8217;t invited until 50 years later. Think I&#8217;m going to rest now. I have finally figured out the conflict of my novel! Finished my word count for the day, but now have to make up for skipping yesterday. Now just one problem : How to shut my mind up while I have to work or sleep?</p>

    <p>And yes, I&#8217;m plinking away at my word count on my phone. I write fairy tales. I just want to go back home and hide in the world I&#8217;m writing about. My hand is killing me so I guess I&#8217;m gonna stop at 40k tonight. Nope, my novel won&#8217;t allow it!</p>

    <p>Halfway there to my word goal for 4000 for the day! I typed &#8220;the yare&#8221; instead of &#8220;they are&#8221; and discovered that &#8220;yare&#8221; is actually a word! Come join me! Every day I expect to see George R. R. Martin logging into the NaNo forums and saying, &quot;Help! I can&#8217;t even spell anymore.</p>

    <p>Looking like I will take the rest of the week to catch up. Yes, but now I have a reason to wake up tomorrow. Oh man I wish I had done this earlier!</p>

    <p>This is the moment when I hit 25K words! There are no goats in my novel. I&#8217;m at 24339 for my word count tonight! I just passed the 25000 mark!!! Now as soon as I write 1,000 words, I can get some.</p>

    <p>Wondering if this comfy seat drains my brain&#8217;s ability to remember things&#8230; I feel like it&#8217;s eating my life. I am DOING it! &quot; I have no sense of time, but in November I always know what day it is.</p>

    <p>You may think I&#8217;m avoiding writing my story. A thing that may or may jot be making an appearance in my story soon : the Pear of Anguish. Guess What I&#8217;ve been doing all night? I don&#8217;t feel like writing.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m still going to try to make it. This song revolves around my NaNoWriMo story. Now I&#8217;m just sleepy af. So if I want to make up for my missed words yesterday, I have to write over 3k words today.</p>

    <p>I think it helped me find out about Marcie and her mother. I think. 900 words to go, and I am feeling the pressure. Maybe I should start on the sequel? So lost I&#8217;m my writing I forgot to eat.</p>

    <p>Tonight I&#8217;m heading to a write in. And with that, I finished my goal of passing the 23,000 word mark. Tomorrow, so help me, I&#8217;ll start the catch up process. I wrote 6898 words today.</p>

    <p>Is that the end I see in the distance? I did it ma!!!! That&#8217;ll work for my universe&#8230; I wrote 6656 words today. I&#8217;ve got a lot of work to do.</p>

    <p>I CAN DO EEEET!!! Just occurred to me that I&#8217;m writing this book out of order and didn&#8217;t know it. I hit 30.000 words yesterday. Maybe I&#8217;ll start one. She sounds like my daughter.</p>

    <p>I just hit 15,000 a bit ago&#8230; 16,000 words on my project. Monday I shall conquer!</p>

    <p>Wish me luck! In my story, I have one word that isn&#8217;t said. In any case, I am almost done what will probably be the longest story in the collection. I&#8217; ll. I can go to bed now&#8230;</p>

    <p>This has not been my month. Officially hit 50 pages in my manuscript today. Can I get a WHOOP! I passed 25k today!! I don&#8217;t even like cake.</p>

    <p>I found the darkness and my inspiration again. And suddenly I&#8217;m in the mood to write. I HIT THE 25K MARK I AM FEELING ALMIGHTY!</p>

    <p>Behave yourselves while I&#8217;m gone. I WILL catch up today. Think that I should make writing my career! I&#8217;m at 25,000 words! I can almost see the climax from here! Ending my second night on 8,689 words.</p>

    <p>Another 1151 and I will be all caught up for the day!! Wish me luck. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a coincidence that I&#8217;ve run into the person who was the inspiration for my story the last two weekends. I need some adderall.</p>

    <p>Mentioned I skipped 2 hanky panky scenes to write later. I&#8217;m going to close my eyes and count to five. THIS is the book I&#8217;ve been trying to write for a year now. For my characters&#8217; sake I must intercede! Now I think I deserve some chocolate. Finally broke my writers block! Now I gonna go collapse&#8230;</p>

    <p>I wrote 5k without checking my word count. 34,106 and I&#8217;m done for the night. Halfway to my goal. but I did manage 400 words on the way into work!</p>

    <p>Hear me roar. I feel torn between trying to get another 1000 or going out to have beer and scotch. I can&#8217;t believe straightforwardness is actually a word. &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m going to attack you later tonight. Well, I am FINALLY caught up. Current thoughts : My MC is&#8230;not doing what I want her to do!</p>

    <p>Sheesh, guess I&#8217;m just a passenger on this drive. I think so! Well that scene just gave me chills. just over 1500 words until I reach 50k.</p>

    <p>3,000 words into my goal of 6,000 for the day. Another 1107 words to help get me back on target. To think I almost gave up earlier today bahahahaha. Tomorrow will consist of my bed and MacBook.</p>

    <p>I managed 1500 words with a headache and one eye shut. I am a novelist in distress. Con : Boyfriend&#8217;s going to stop me from writing&#8217; til sunday. I might just have to put this song on repeat until I finish this draft. Since I don&#8217;t write on Sundays I wanted to be at 40k today.</p>

    <p>I wrote 1300 words on my phone. The hubs and I are settled in at either end of the &#8220;dining room&#8221; table. Since I can&#8217;t even get that done. 15 minute WARNING my Wordlings.</p>

    <p>I started with a novel I started LAST year.. You don&#8217;t understand it, how can I explain? I can totally do this.</p>

    <p>Passed 20K in my manuscript! Took everything I had to hit word count today. I think it still counts. I am halfway to the goal I set for today!</p>

    <p>SLEEPING What am I doing? &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! Sis1 is begging me to watch a movie with her?</p>

    <p>I knew this was coming. I can&#8217;t feel my hand anymore&#8230; But my characters need me. I&#8217;m already thinking of next year. I can see the completion of the 1st draft of my 1st novel on the horizon! I am not about to lose!</p>

    <p>Writing til my fingers fall off. The tension is killing me. I am DOING it! Besides I got my 25k badge tonight!</p>

    <p>One of my characters was murdered. Report those words, my lovelies!!! Yes, I know I should be over 26,000 by today. Writing throwaway scenes until I hit something I like. I just lost my entire book. And now, to editing my novel!</p>

    <p>Did my character just introduce a plot twist out of left field? Look out, here comes my train of thought! Listening to Jeff Buckley as I write.</p>

    <p>Now I can drink beer and watch football without the guilt trip. Trying to find my mojo. I wrote over 1,600 words yesterday, bringing my total to 45,690. I&#8217;m failing today.</p>

    <p>I have a sore wrist from overuse. Passing 21k and feeling like I might be approaching a wall&#8230; I&#8217;m on track! PLOT TWIST my MC just got thrown into jail.</p>

    <p>Feel like I&#8217;m picking up steam again, though. Did I write my 1.5K words? Just wish they could fall into my head in the daytime. Watch me finish by next week! Just realised I now have 25k written!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m three days ahead. Wish I could be in San Fran tonight, but the Writer&#8217;s Place in KC is rocking tonight, too! I want the boy gone. I&#8217;m out! I think there was coffee???</p>

    <p>I think if someone had explained to me that writing is a lot like playing god, well, I would have started this years ago. I think I&#8217;ll call it a night. Ugh. I haven&#8217;t written in days. I have earned one sticker today. Opened my Word doc to discover that 17,544 words is really only 64 d.s. pages.</p>

    <p>Don&#8217;t think I can finish. Let me spend my Saturday night with you. I like the voice of my MC. I only wrote 1955 words 2day. I wrote a throwaway line that resulted in a 4,000 word plane hijack sequence.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve typed till my hand hurts. Gotta kill my word count this weekend! Maybe I&#8217;ll give it another go next year, hmm&#8230; I think I&#8217;m pooped for the night. I think I may have exceeded expectations this month. I only have to write 200 words at a time.</p>

    <p>I just have 1,000 to go and I&#8217;ll have my count for the day. I WISH I could remember how I imagined this conversation this morning. tiny girl won&#8217;t get off of my lap. I stroke out the bullets as points are written in or discarded. &#8220; &#8221;Nothing, my dear Frodo.</p>

    <p>I turns out I&#8217;ve written over 2K today. Hopeful I can get over 10K done but Im running out of scenes to write! I will make 20k words today.</p>

    <p>My favourite writing tool is my red pen. After a decade working on it, I haven&#8217;t the foggiest. Going to edit my manuscript from now until bedtime. Related : I HIT 25K WORDS!</p>

    <p>2000 of my words didn&#8217;t save last night. And I hit a block&#8230; Thinking I will make the final 17,529, I suck, I suck, I suuuck. I&#8217;m trying to hit 25,000 tomorrow in order to catch up. I am DOING it!</p>

    <p>Today I reached 17K! Do you think I can do? We&#8217;ll see if I can do it! It&#8217;s SCREAMING at me to write it! Think I&#8217;ll make that my target and then get some rest.</p>

    <p>I do not like novel writing on my phone. That&#8217;s the only way I have a prayer of finishing&#8230; I feel like the answer is no&#8230; Who&#8217;s with me? Things I did yesterday : Hit the 25,000 word mark! let me know the deets!</p>

    <p>Maybe I should get a puppy. I will write another time&#8230; I might just go get me an ice cream cake! Trying to get back into it so I don&#8217;t lose a second day. I passed 25k words!</p>

    <p>Now she&#8217;s getting punished&#8230;why do my characters do this to themselves? &#8220; I equate writing it with &#8221;vomiting. Been waiting for this since I started writing. My story isn&#8217;t done but I hit the minimum!</p>

    <p>I needed a break. How do I block a hashtag? Somebody go out and buy me a candy bar. I figured out the problem!! Thought I&#8217;d got over this hump on Monday. If I could just&#8230;</p>

    <p>There is something I must write! But I have to keep going through the sludge. Today is my day for getting back on track! Tomorrow I need to hit 25k to be back on track.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m running out of synonyms for deformed&#8230; Let me spend my Saturday night with you. I needed a night away from writing over 2k. But I will definitely hit it tomorrow.</p>

    <p>I might be hitting my tipping point though. I need to&#8230; And will continue on with my Sunday. I&#8217;m so close.</p>

    <p>My head hurts and I only got out 500 words today. Wohoo I&#8217;m at 50k, I should be at 57k by the end of this day. my characters are going to bed, but I have to stay up. And yes, I feel just as itchy about that one extra word as you imagine.</p>

    <p>Stretch goals, I have them. I&#8217;m trying to matter. I&#8217;m back on track! After I put my laundry away, I am FINALLY start writing. Now I&#8217;m mobile!!</p>

    <p>After not writing for two days, I would like to reach 30k today. Why am I here?? I am starting to have a legitimate fear that I will not finish in time this year. After I eat and take a nap.</p>

    <p>But I&#8217;m writing. &#8220; the giant announced, handing me a broomstick. But now that I&#8217;ve been fed and watered, I feel motivated to write! &#8221; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days. I can&#8217;t catch up from this&#8230;</p>

    <p>Can anyone tell me what it feels like to be shot by an arrow? Everything I get now will be over 1667! Now to bullshit my way through a million and one appendices. &quot; I HIT 25K!</p>

    <p>Away from me, ye stouthearted, that are on&#8230; she&#8217;s so big that she crashed my work computer&#8230; Even tho my dad died Nov 6, doing funeral stuff,family I just gotta write the novel. &quot; What if I don&#8217;t find any gems? I have finally crossed the 35,000 word threshold.</p>

    <p>Pausing in my current crawl to eat lunch. I feel like I&#8217;ve been writing forever and I&#8217;ve only written 800 words. Why must I have such a competitive nature? Even though at times I have no clue how to start.</p>

    <p>I broke 26,000 words! I&#8217;d have to write 5500 words today to get caught up. I&#8217;m closer and loser to my 7k goal! I can&#8217;t wait to hear what you think of it. I&#8217;ll go again in 27 minutes.</p>

    <p>I did end up writing 1024 words bringing me to a total word count of 20045, so I&#8217;m still on tract. Time to FINALLY get my writing on! I&#8217;m getting started on my writing. I still have to catch up from missed days with the migraine. &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days!</p>

    <p>I need to find a way to put it in my story. I wrote the word&#8217; funnest. I should see this to the END. I just blew up my point of view character.</p>

    <p>I want time to read a book. ewww my characters are kissing.. I need 8,000 words to catch up today. I like this character.</p>

    <p>Above and beyond my personal goal : just hit 25.1k! &#8220; I prefer the term &#8221;power nuggets. Literally writing in my sleep. Confession : I dislike writing dialogue. HOW DO I GO ON?</p>

    <p>I just hit 25,018 words. I go drink some alcohol now. I am. Let&#8217;s see if I can hit 2k! I lied. I need Freddie Roach to coach me through it.</p>

    <p>I like the tabs feature helps with sectioning. 30k words today and I have the rest of it all mapped out. I gotta step it up. Well, I&#8217;ve written over 10K today&#8230; Wish I could go up 1k each day but life starts again tomorrow.</p>

    <p>I won last time writing 25k in the last 4 days. I wrote 4K today. Going to get some writing in as I wait for stuff. I&#8217;ve got to write 8k tomorrow. Word count hit, and I&#8217;m sitting at just over 31k. I&#8217;m about at my total for 2013 already. In my Hawaiian shirt Writing my novel.</p>

    <p>Can&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;ve heard anyone use it. I&#8217;m ahead and I want to stay ahead and have ALL the words. I swear I&#8217;ll write&#8230;. I need to. Added 2,013 words to my WIP.</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s morning, and I&#8217;m still freaking out about these characters who are kissing without authorization. Alright, today I&#8217;ll be rebalancing some on my draft, so won&#8217;t be moving forward, but fleshing out. Ok. In 6 minutes, I&#8217;m going to start writing. I wish I could just stop. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m aiming for today.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll take it. Now it&#8217;s time for sleep before my brain turns to jelly. Novel, why do you want to be written NOW, when my battery is low and I have to go to bed soon?!</p>

    <p>I have officially hit the halfway mark. Ideas coming faster than I could compose. Hopefully, I will hit 20,000 tonight. I also cleaned the toilets.</p>

    <p>My MC just looked and me and said, &quot;Now what do you want me to do? Feel I&#8217;ve hit a wall of exposition. If I can manage just over 5k words today I will finally be caught up on my word count. I might just reach that today! I need to work on writing fight scenes.</p>

    <p>I made boozy Butterbeer. Do you have any words I can use? I can&#8217;t talk to him anymore because he knows who I am. Did my words for today. Can I count going to a writing workshop as my word count for the day?</p>

    <p>I got this! I&#8217;m going for 25,000 words today. I found the darkness and my inspiration again. I have a novel to write. Actual phrase I wrote today : &quot;tender tendrils.</p>

    <p>But I am using November to start my second novel, codenamed &#8220;The Forest of Eternal Youth&#8221; Who thinks I can catch up tonight? How do I word? But I must resist&#8230; But I&#8217;m not even close to finished yet!!</p>

    <p>The poster only contained one sentence : &quot;Can I eat my songs? Trying to find the place I left off in my word doc and I just&#8230;.keep&#8230;.scrolling!! Well, I didn&#8217;t hit 2k words tonight but that&#8217;s alright. I have yWriter installed. Time to take a break and let my brain figure out what&#8217;s happening next.</p>

    <p>I am DOING it! wish me luck! I even took a snooze. I&#8217;m writing to 90&#8217;s pop music. I&#8217;m stuck! I have about 4000 words to write today to catch up. Now I know I can handle deadlines.</p>

    <p>Go me! Do I have to block him again? Yeah, I can do that.</p>

    <p>I am killing week 2! I am so behiiiiiind. Now I must go get lunch.</p>

    <p>Guys, I don&#8217;t know how to deal with this, I&#8217;m usually such a procrastinator. Fixing a scene that I wrote earlier today. Hopefully I can catch up soon&#8230; finished three out of eleven pages for my test. listening to &#8220;I Know Places&#8221; by Tswift while my characters are running from robots.</p>

    <p>I should have made it, may not January. I have novel writing to do! Someone give me a prompt! I need storylines. And I like what I found.</p>

    <p>I am DOING it! I need 13,328 words to make it to the halfway point. My word count is already at 2500 for the day and I&#8217;m not even close to done! I would rather hide under my covers with a book. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m writing but it will definitely be made out of words.</p>

    <p>Teen because I write crappy like one. 505 words but what am I even doing? Partly because of home issues, partly because the YA idea I had needs help with the voice.</p>

    <p>Today I tried a chapter in 1st person. It looks like I&#8217;ll reach 35K words by the end of tomorrow. It&#8217;s a 5k Weekend and I&#8217;m almost done. Should do my AM yoga, but my MC still hasn&#8217;t gotten to kiss her crush yet.</p>

    <p>3000 words, here I come. nothing is going to stop me from hitting 40k words tonight. I will not cry. I shall now be breaking for some Call of Duty : AW. I&#8217;m TIIIIRRREEEDDD.</p>

    <p>I can do this. That means I have to write like 5000 words today. I made this guy in novel drive somewhere and then drink. I know it&#8217;s a slog but keep at it.</p>

    <p>I just reached 25k! I am FLYING through this novel! Somewhere along the way, I crossed 40k. What about my wordcount?</p>

    <p>The only thing I&#8217;m doing for the next two days is writing fiction and reading books about writing. &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! I can&#8217;t even deal, guys. if I can.)</p>

    <p>I can totally do this. I&#8217;ve finally hit 5 digits on the NaNoWriMo. So I hit 48.2k words today. This weekend a stayover friend is going to occupy my son.</p>

    <p>But I&#8217;m writing. I will finish this draft! I&#8217;m at the turn in the story.</p>

    <p>I am DOING it! The story I&#8217;m writing has just about every Disney Princess trope possible in it, but no singing. The only words I want to write are &quot;THE END. I need to stop drinking coffee at night. I supposed I could start tomorrow&#8217;s count after midnight, but I need to rest.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m hoping tons and tons? I will double my word count by Monday. &quot; You can&#8217;t lose me. Last year I made a human being. I can do this!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m going to take a break and try to deal with my life for a minute. I think so. So it&#8217;s no surprise I&#8217;ve sent a snow storm into my story. Add me peeps! I have been writing like the WIND today.</p>

    <p>Well, that explains my sudden otherwise irrational phobia of shovels. To catch up to the 25,000 mark, I need 10,042 words. I saw this happened to someone else last week.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m clearing the decks. I need 2522 words per day 15 days would be 37,830. I&#8217;ve written about 3000 words today which is wayyyy below what I need to catch up. I&#8217;m over halfway there!</p>

    <p>I always had a &#8220;rush&#8221; problem in my writing. So I guess I&#8217;ll keep going. Thank you brain for working while I slept. Today I&#8217;m going to try and get those words done before evening, o I won&#8217;t need to rush through it like last night. I can do it&#8230;</p>

    <p>Taking a short break so I don&#8217;t burn out. I&#8217;ve caught up to the rest of the world. I made it! Now I&#8217;m mobile!! I can finally sleep!!!!!</p>

    <p>I just don&#8217;t know how to write it. I&#8217;m really starting to procrastinate with my writing, not starting until 9. Works for me! Of course, now I need to find the time to type so that I can add them to my word count. I have so earned another coffee.</p>

    <p>Youngest cat is beside the computer, oldest is draped over my shoulders. Officially writing about an island I never intended to. Now I have purpose. She sounds like my daughter. Someone help me. I&#8217;m almost caught up again!</p>

    <p>Can someone pleas ehelp me somehow? Tonight, I get caught up. (I like choosing who to write about). I am DOING it!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve just counted what I wrote during a day. Can somebody please keep an eye on my characters while I&#8217;m gone? This happens once before I write a chapter. Number of words I just wrote too. Just got the idea for a revision &#8220;to do&#8221; spreadsheet for things I know I want to revise after November.</p>

    <p>Am I at the halfway point in my novel? If I continue to make up words I could probably get to 30k today. (Yea, I like 15&#8217; s&#8230;) I want to be undefeated.</p>

    <p>I won&#8217;t give up! Afterwards, I may tackle 40k. if I can.) I swear Im trying to write, but that&#8217;s The Mummy&#8217;s Return on tv!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m not bragging I swear! I&#8217;ve discovered French rap. Someone remind me why I&#8217;m still doing this to myself. I did not see that coming.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m at 28k. I type it out and say&#8230; Why didn&#8217;t I think of this before? I have 2 hours to bang out 2k words. Close to 25K, but my vision is blurring, it&#8217;s time to call it a night.</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t like this feeling!!! Day 14 Starting to feel like I&#8217;ve hit a rut. I guess I&#8217;ll get some morning words in.</p>

    <p>Wish me luck! I&#8217;m gonna watch Castle. Because I&#8217;m writing, and I just made myself cry. I have to hit 25,000 words by tomorrow. Today I moved the folder into the pine trees.</p>

    <p>Don&#8217;t judge me. I am DOING it! Working with some buddies to help with my Writing! Who&#8217;s with me? I took a day off to do some reading and relaxing.</p>

    <p>But I&#8217;m writing. Now treating myself to a couple of days off, and I&#8217;ll get back to it after the weekend. Can I make it? I know I can catch up but ughhh it&#8217;s daunting.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m halfway there! I made it thru the Night of Writing Dangerously last night with 5,958 added words! I wrote over 7,000 words tonight, and my total word count is now 37,628. And as soon as I figure out how to post it, I&#8217;ll put it up in the room.</p>

    <p>I just wrote 1377 words in 15 minutes. I&#8217;m thinking dialogue for pace. Here&#8217;s hoping I get to sleep before midnight. I lied.</p>

    <p>This is my public promise to write 1000 words before doing anything else once I wake up tomorrow. I advise to write short articles. Did I say 2,847? I&#8217;m getting there&#8230; Nawww lookkit my Main Character being all mature and shit!</p>

    <p>Feeling really tearful as I am taking the little boy character back to his home in Ancient Britain via a time traveling boat! I have a feeling a lot of this backstory will be edited out&#8230;next month, when I do a rewrite. Where did I put my blinders? Saturday night and I ain&#8217;t got nobody.</p>

    <p>I might just have to go for it and finish 50,000 by tomorrow. I will make it to 50000 words. Please forget me. &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! I like writing him&#8230;</p>

    <p>I am DOING it! Only 191 words this morning, but I think I have had a plot breakthrough&#8230; I successfully tricked myself into writing 4000 words today, so I am only a day and a half behind!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;d forgotten how helpful word wars can be! Cycling 12 miles today has worn me out, had an emergency nap. Why yes, I did just hit that mark.</p>

    <p>Yet what I am doing? :o) But tomorrow I have to go back to work&#8230; Is it possible for me to get to 25K tonight? I will not. I needs some help&#8230;.My writing drive is gone. I was 2500 words ahead of my daily goal since day 7 and today I have barely reached it.</p>

    <p>Just found out my Italian roots could have Irish ties&#8230; Think I may have reached a point where my characters are not just puppets. At this rate I will finish on time. I love the Queen&#8217;s willow tree, it has such a whimsical feel to it, she serves her tea beneath the willow tree, nearly always.</p>

    <p>That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to write. And thus my writing day comes to an end. I&#8217;m just over 10,000 words away. This 100 000 words in a month idea is killing me. I can hear the blood rushing thru my veins when I stand up.</p>

    <p>I sense a major rewrite in my future. I can write 2k words an hour. I&#8217;ve had it. But I just wrote 3k words at the library. Shit just got real in my story.</p>

    <p>I HAVE DONE IT! By the end of the weekend, my WIP should be at 30K! I am when writing 11.65 words away from one word a second. I&#8217;m trying to figure it out.</p>

    <p>Edit my personal essay or write the opening scene of this story that&#8217;s been percolating? If you want to add me on the site, my name is Veranza. Got my first half of 1,000 written.</p>

    <p>I had a crisis during my writing time and then life happened. I wanna see tons of wordies. I&#8217;ve seen it. I&#8217;m officially halfway there!</p>

    <p>That means I&#8217;m officially caught up. I have a contract offer! I&#8217;ve crossed the finish like yesterday. Excuse me, new novel idea.</p>

    <p>21,689 I can&#8217;t believe I hit the day&#8217;s word goal. I believe it does! I&#8217;ve got 31,071 words! I hit 7k tonight! Two weeks in and I finally find my voice for the story. I think the flu has hit our house. I write what I want and edit later.</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t even want to see how many words I am behind, but I just know it&#8217;s a lot. Can I add all the tweets I&#8217;ve written in November to my word count? I don&#8217;t care, I&#8217;m taking a shower. Twitter is still a bit of a mystery to me.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll be sprinting tomorrow if you&#8217;re around. No clue what I&#8217;m doing next. didn&#8217;t hit my 35K goal for the weekend, but I&#8217;m close and I only have about 8 scenes left to write! Still a bit behind but I&#8217;ll catch up today or tomorrow for sure.</p>

    <p>If I have all day, it takes all day. I just taught Scrivener the word &#8220;snarky&#8221;. Trying to ignore everything around me so I can write! I haven&#8217;t heard much about it and I&#8217;m still not ready to participate.</p>

    <p>I resolved to actual pen and paper since the computer was too distracting tonight. I can do it! I might write something today. 40k now, can I make 50k in 1 sitting? I actually spent the whole day doing homework&#8230;</p>

    <p>Brings me up to 31,562. The guilt stops me. Hopefully tomorrow I can make a dent in that. I&#8217;ve got a word count to hit, and the only thing that can help me is the Far Cry 3 : Blood Dragon soundtrack.</p>

    <p>Apparently my word counts tend toward a logaritmic graph, rather than a linear one. I have no idea where it&#8217;s going. I&#8217;ll take it, and face the coming week with determination and bravery. Nope, just my input?</p>

    <p>So, I just need to spend about eight hours writing tomorrow in order to get caught up. Gonna hit 25k tonight if it kills me. I&#8217;m hoping to make up for it by reaching the 40k mark tomorrow. This is me in shock!</p>

    <p>I got 1,113 words, bringing me over today&#8217;s word goal! Atlantis is on, so I&#8217;ll go word hunting. &quot; Apparently I can&#8217;t think of foul enough language when I&#8217;m typing fast.</p>

    <p>I had no idea how to react. that convo I just added came from out of nowhere and was about my other main character but I think it works&#8230; Oh alright who am I kidding? I need to stop writing in cafes. I started this section of the book where a major event was supposed to happen.</p>

    <p>Also my heroine totally did something that surprised me! Just got my proof copy in the mail today! Night writing here I come! Broke 19K last night, and writing is getting easier though my schedule is not.</p>

    <p>Managed to hit my 2k word goal for the day, but it was a grind. Wrote 333 words this AM, to put me at 20,102 for the beginning of Day 13. I&#8217;m worn out from hiking. I got about 1200 words done last night, introduced two new characters.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m having issues with a char&#8217;s development, so I&#8217;m putting together a playlist based on what I think his tastes are. Except maybe not because I just realized I&#8217;ve only written 200 words since my last word count. And now I get to eat food. I&#8217;m have no discipline.</p>

    <p>Tonight, I get caught up. Family are forcing me away! Which is why I&#8217;m trolling twitter now. This year I will finish. And my characters have only just left the first town.</p>

    <p>&#8220; &#8221;Nothing, my dear Frodo. Put an Easter egg of Dumbledore&#8217;s office into my description of the Wizard&#8217;s laboratory. then walk my dog&#8230; It&#8217;s part of my National Novel Writing Decade.</p>

    <p>I have been working on my novel for the last six hours and I literally cannot stop. I really, really don&#8217;t want to write right now. I slacked. I am DOING it! I just got over 3000 words for the day! One of my favorite issues of the past year!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m actually in the middle of reading the Dresden Files right now. &#8230;but it&#8217;s the same place every time, my bed! This is the story of me, Virginia Woolf! I am stuck in the doldrums. Nothing&#8217;s coming to me.</p>

    <p>So I&#8217;m going to settle for anything. I&#8217;m about to faceplant into my computer. 6,000 words later, I still haven&#8217;t gotten there. How will I catch it? I saved these from Adam.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the WRiMOS computer, I&#8217;m up to 35,000 words and I can finally sleep. I&#8217;ve got my son and my birthday, and thanksgiving coming up though. Maybe I should get a puppy.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m protective over my art. I just wrote something that would mean I wouldn&#8217;t allow this novel to see the light of day. I wanted to go to bed but ended up writing. Above par, yay me! I prefer loud rock music.</p>

    <p>can I do it?? Not of writing, just tired and wish I had more time. And my college assignments, but eh. How many times can I spell my heroine&#8217;s name wrong? Not that I&#8217;m anywhere near halfway done with my novel.</p>

    <p>Yes I&#8217;ve been writing for an hour. I&#8217;ve abandoned my New Adult novel to write children&#8217;s historical fiction AND still won&#8217;t admit I&#8217;ve got writer&#8217;s ADD. I&#8217;ve been waiting for this since I started writing. I&#8217;m over 21K! I&#8217;ve reached that point where I have to organize my notes and fix my outline. I am DOING it! 2032 words so far, to bring me to 39052.</p>

    <p>Come join me! &#8230;that I am here for him if he ever just can&#8217;t take the silence anymore&#8230; I&#8217;ll catch you. I really want to start writing my third novel idea&#8230;</p>

    <p>Can I just delete everything I&#8217;ve written this month and start over? Had to meet my word quota for today and I did. I feel your pain. On the contrary, I am liberated!</p>

    <p>Haha, I&#8217;m approaching 3,000 for today and I&#8217;m realizing that 8,000 isn&#8217;t feasible at all. but I sort of want to. I can&#8217;t believe it! I hope so. Debating if I should reach for 100k tonight.</p>

    <p>What do I write? This is the story of me, Virginia Woolf! Netflix time with the boyfriend is my reward! I&#8217;m in the home stretch!</p>

    <p>Wow, I wrote 1,554 words. Still feeling like I can catch up. I&#8217;ll be doing the word thang. No clue what I&#8217;m writing next. I should be on track to hit halfway by Sunday. now i want to put snow in my story even though it&#8217;s the end of summer.</p>

    <p>I am getting some Thai food and heading home early to get my write on. I&#8217;m supposed to be writing&#8230; That hurt my word count some. If I would actually focus I could probably get to 5K for today&#8230; last night I hit my halfway mark!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a novelist. I&#8217;m TRYING. I make that a promise to myself! I am the slowest! Fueling up with some chinese food, then hunkering down to put in as many words as I can tonight.</p>

    <p>I think I&#8217;m doing alright. Now that my school musical is over, my main focus is going to be writing. I&#8217;m on a roll! I feel like it&#8217;s eating my life. Probably the last time I&#8217;ll do that until my first novel comes out in early 2015.</p>

    <p>Tummy is full of sushi, I&#8217;m back in my pjs, let&#8217;s finish this fight scene from earlier this morning. Passed 13k words, so over a quarter of the way through at last (when I should be halfway tho). Looks like I have double writing to do today. Can I just write to 30K today?</p>

    <p>Nevertheless I wanna say : I was on the edge of my seat while writing it. Never me, obvs. I&#8217;ll be answering questions on here from 6. Tomorrow is a big writing day for me!</p>

    <p>I need to ruin my protagonists lifes. I literally vant mm not tuopst. I&#8217;m so not in the mood to write. Not going to make 50K at this rate, but my goal was to write every day and get this story in motion. I need to catch up.</p>

    <p>But today I feel like I&#8217;m slogging. I seem to have lost some words from word overnight. I have a recurring nightmare that Waylon comes home from work early and discovers I live in squalor from 6AM to 5PM.</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll reach 50k. Writing took forever today, but I hit word count. We have a love hate relationship and right now, I love you.</p>

    <p>You, me, computer, Bria Lana and all those gods crowding in her head. I gotta be like Alanna in Corus and Mulan in her &#8220;Be a Man&#8221; montage and PERSEVERE! Just read next scene in my plan. Wish me luck. Well, maybe I can use this time I unexpectedly have to try to get the day&#8217;s quota written before everyone comes home!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m on a roll! &#8220; &#8221;Nothing, my dear Frodo. I keep on reminding myself that this is only the first draft.</p>

    <p>I got to 28,821 words yesterday, so I technically don&#8217;t HAVE to write today, but I can&#8217;t let this writer&#8217;s block fester! Can&#8217;t wait to get out of work so I can go home, and write. I hit a wall at 22,000 words. I have to settle for the snowy darkness out here in east canada, but one day I&#8217;ll join you! Finally I like it! All I want is to get to 1k this morning but stuff keeps pulling me away from the laptop. I have an hour until I need to go pick up my kid at school.</p>

    <p>The end is coming up on me faster than I&#8217;d like. I need a spring buddy! I am over halfway through my novel!! 23,355 for the month so far, which means I&#8217;m on target!</p>

    <p>I need to kick on. I just need Two. Finishing my Buffy essay today. Going to melt these key with my fast fingers today!</p>

    <p>Total word count : 25116 I&#8217;m now over halfway! I&#8217;m at 46,111! Kickin ass on my word count today! Officially my highest word count so far!</p>

    <p>I think I can. Nearly 18,000 words toward my NaNoWriMo novel! I am entitled to watch television now. Woke up thinking about my MS Blood Vision. Immediately regretted those initial caps because my iPhone keyboard hates me. Wrote nearly 4,000 words today, in spite of all of my distractions on Twitter!</p>

    <p>Hit 30,000 words and I&#8217;m feeling pretty low&#8230; This is me vowing to hit the 25k word point by midnight. I almost got 2,000 words in today! I wish I could write it differently, but that&#8217;s not how things happened.</p>

    <p>I know I&#8217;m often not sure while writing, but this time, it feels more so. Yes, yes I know I&#8217;m still above the target I want MOOOAARR! Grad school has been kicking my butt this Nov! Squeezed my run and shower in there too.</p>

    <p>Wow, you guys are tweeting me with some high numbers. I am wondering about the narrator. To think I almost gave up earlier today bahahahaha. I must write.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m so far behind but I&#8217;m feeling good about today. I can do this. I&#8217;ve totally lost my marbles in the last five minutes or so. I am finally up to date so have allowed myself 10 mins on Twitter. I have LOTS of ideas!</p>

    <p>I swear can any more people stand a few feet from the computer and chat loudly? Anyone seen my motivation today? I feel this.</p>

    <p>No really I&#8217;m starting a fire in the fireplace. Husband is hogging the laptop, and I still need to do about 300 words tonight. Can I write 20,000 words in four days? Every time I almost catch up, the clock rolls over. But I am now working on finishing this novel. &quot; I can&#8217;t decide whether you should live or die.</p>

    <p>I need 8685 words in 24 hours to catch up to par. Halfway through the month, and I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m still on pace! Hit 20K words finally, which means I have 30K left to write, still a bit behind but happy for what I&#8217;ve accomplished. Closing pinterest because I was justifying my pins as &#8220;writing inspiration&#8221;. I wonder if I can finish by Monday despite work? When I don&#8217;t like a section, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve either said too little or too much.</p>

    <p>3,245 words written today, putting me at 31,253 total. I say &#8220;the end&#8221;. It cuts my security. I achived my daily goal. an hour of genius brainstorming and stream of consciousness has put new life into my story.</p>

    <p>I have a lot of sprinting to do. I have written past the daily wordcount goal today, but still got a lot of catching up to do. And I write for NaNo at night, so I can, so I can Keep track of plot lines in my mind. I reached 25k words! I write for NaNo at night so I can, so I can Watch my word count climb to brand new heights.</p>

    <p>I said I needed to understand the layout of Paris for my novel, my husband suggested buying the new Assassin&#8217;s Creed. I&#8217;m at 9,782 words now but I can type 2,000 wph. Do I ruin my childhood memories by googling what they look like now? &#8220; &#8221;Nothing, my dear Frodo. What do I do when I hit a wall in a story? Logan woke up at 4 a.m. with me this morning, but I got him back to sleep and actually still hit my word count!</p>

    <p>I will make up for it over the weekend. I&#8217;ll stop now. &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! With all of the new ideas I&#8217;ve got, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that I&#8217;m not a genre writer.</p>

    <p>Wrote another 3.5k for my new novel yesterday. Someone needs to lock me into a room with a laptop (but without wifi) and not let me out until I have written enough words. Officially halfway to my goal! Wrote 2,323 words today which puts me over 40K.</p>

    <p>I was hoping to finish my entire novel in Nov. Word count down the drain as I attack huge blocks of text. I want time to read a book. I think my hand is going to fall off. I know because I am writing new gospels about it.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve now reached the point where my outlining ends. I didn&#8217;t know it was going to get this deep. &quot; A sentence I never thought I would write. I&#8217;ve cracked 30,000 words on my new novel.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow I want to work on my SEKRIT PROJECT, though. I&#8217;m not a competitive person, but give me 30 days to write 50k, and a list of opponents&#8230; I can definitely get 50k words on paper, but that won&#8217;t really mean the completion of my first draft. I can&#8217;t wait to start editing. &quot;&#8230;And miles to go before I sleep. This chapter is such a mess, I&#8217;d rather do laundry right now.</p>

    <h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>I have written 6K today. 2500 words today makes my current WC 21661. Surpassed my daily goal with 1786, but I still have a little catching up to do.</p>

    <p>Still writing by the seat of my pants. I&#8217;m beat. I&#8217;m gonna go for it. I&#8217;m going to need chocolate. not many but something I didn&#8217;t expect just happened and I&#8217;m excited to find out what happens next.</p>

    <p>just like my characters are in my story. What shall I do? Tell me I wanna know. That 25k badge coming up is my only motivation right now.</p>

    <p>Just hit 10,000 for the second time&#8230;which is halfway to where I should be right now. I have somehow managed to keep up with my word count though. I&#8217;m doing a marathon weekend to make up some ground. lawd please let me be productive tonight. I don&#8217;t regret this decision.</p>

    <p>Right, time to see how much further I can get. Heading into my third writing session of the day. I also wrote 2k words today. I wrote about 2700 words yesterday&#8230; I&#8217;m shooting for 3K today. So I pull over to the side of the road and I heard &quot;Son do you know why I criticized your novel for?</p>

    <p>Brainstorming a list of people who might want to kill my MC. I&#8217;m in Part II. I&#8217;m stoked where my stories are taking me. I know what i want to write I just can&#8217;t get it out. Barrelling along to complete todays 5k challenge and to reach my personal goal of 25K words before tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Missed my writing goal yesterday by 600 words. I spent the whole day making art. Now it&#8217;s 12:56 am, and I&#8217;m about to sprint before passing out. Going to make this an all day writing event for me. Because I can barely keep up this year.</p>

    <p>I am not going to get this thing written by the end of the month. What happened to my Scrivener! And still, I&#8217;m on twitter. I hope it works. I almost dropped one of my major plot points today because I just couldn&#8217;t make it work.</p>

    <p>I write about 10k monthly, so. New record and now my brain is mush. Should probably make a word count target or I&#8217;ll never get anything done. I need this arc to be done. Technically at 13497 I have to get in about 7000 more words to be technically caught up Not sure I&#8217;ll be able to do that tonight.</p>

    <p>I have officially crossed the halfway point. I hit 34,000 words and realized it&#8217;s getting close to the time when things should blow to holy hell! This year I kept it to 75. 2,000 words and I&#8217;m not to the main scene of this part yet.</p>

    <p>I can stop now or maybe keep the story going! That is the question I ask myself as I bullshit another thousand words. I need someone to come tie me up, I need insight into my protagonist&#8217;s situation. I found the main conflict, except I found it at 20k.</p>

    <p>I guess it&#8217;s time for the main characters to fight some ninjas&#8230; Why I have voluntarily chosen to do this to myself I know not. Which means I&#8217;ll have to pull two 5k days in the next week.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m not writing today. I&#8217;m past the midpoint in my first novel and suddenly things are fun again. I want to take either my ChunHo fic or my JaeHo fic and use it. And my two main characters totally just kissed &#8220;in their dreams&#8221;.</p>

    <p>I can&#8217;t converse properly, my brain is full of knives and blood and spears and stuff. If I type nonstop? FINALLY surpassed my work target for the day! 597 words will get me to par. Now that all of twitter knows I won&#8217;t feel intimidated and back out cause then I&#8217;d feel like a loser!</p>

    <p>I regret everything. &#8220; Otherwise, my head will explode. &#8221; &quot;Because I want to work on my novel. Will definitely end before 50k, but there&#8217;s a lot I&#8217;ve realized I need to go back and add earlier on so I might make it anyway. Should be glad it&#8217;s the first time, but am TOTALLY BLOCKED in my story now and doubting every last bit of what I have written.</p>

    <p>Music is distracting me tonight. &#8230;Well, neither did I! Maybe I&#8217;m inspired to add a few more&#8230; 30K words on my nanowip! I might just do this again next month or January! I&#8217;ve written 6000 words today, and am nearly up to where where I need to be.</p>

    <p>I learn more about myself through veering from the plan when writing than other time. 30K is begging for me to make it. I am using the voice notes feature on my phone to record ideas when I am out. Finishing my assignment today, then get back on track with NaNo.</p>

    <p>Now I have several short stories that kind of go together&#8230; &#8220; I&#8217;m all in, &#8221;and he slid over all the childrens gifts. I just found my way out of it! I deserve a break. Now I can breathe.</p>

    <p>I just can&#8217;t make myself write! Focusing on different projects which is killing nano for me but I&#8217;m loving the change back and forth? I hope. Yes, tomorrow I will be! I can see 25,000 by bed time! To my MC : Btw, you will have to kill at least one person fairly soon.</p>

    <p>Today I passed the word count I ended with for last year&#8217;s NaNo. Which cut into my writing. But at least I&#8217;m doing some good works there.</p>

    <p>I am officially at 10,060 words. I&#8217;ll take it. All that being said, I&#8217;m still striving for 50,000 words by Nov. 39K at the end of day 1 of my retreat! At least then I get a better feel for their personalities.</p>

    <p>maybe I should do some writing? Snow covered leaves on my lawn. I&#8217;m ahead! I&#8217;m still writing too for today! Sometimes I am so stoked about this story and others I am completely bummed about it.</p>

    <p>3132 words for today, pushed me to 21625 words total. I need a name for a talking mare. Hey guys guess what I REACHED 50K TODAY. I&#8217;m SO hungry! If this story makes it to 50,000 words, I&#8217;ll be surprised.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m about ready to throw in the towel. Clarity : that last tweet was from my novel. I totally want WRiMOS to come back again.</p>

    <p>I just wanna sleep now. I wanna see high counts. I broke 10K! finished my second nanowrimo, 50,145 words! How much do you guys think I can write while I&#8217;m at work?</p>

    <p>I need to log some words! Yet, I have 22k to go. I have 8000 words to write just to get back on track. I just reached the point where a character wants me to verb &#8220;yolo&#8221;.</p>

    <p>Word count is over 33K and I feel accomplished. I hit 15k words today! I&#8217;ll have this finished yet. I can&#8217;t see anything.</p>

    <p>I feel quite accomplished. Remember that dance party I was going to treat myself to last week? I&#8217;m getting Internal Server Error messages when I try tweeting. I have paper and pen.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve managed 3,743 words today and we&#8217;re officially on our way to hell. At least I got to a pivotal meeting of characters. I&#8217;ll find ya. I find it funny and quite amusing how songs just randomly pop into my head while writing.</p>

    <p>And I&#8217;m finally seeing the light again. Off I go! I&#8217;m canceling my appointments. Not where I wanted to be but I&#8217;ll take it.</p>

    <p>Goal of the day is to break 10k for my total word count. I&#8217;m not super super far ahead but I&#8217;m not behind either. I was never going to finish anyway. It&#8217;s still early on a Friday night and I have to live.</p>

    <p>I am entitled to watch television now. I would like to blame it on the bossa nova, but I do need to write. I have a very functional HP&#8217; 07 at home.</p>

    <p>I know I did! Open question to my follow writers : What would a date with a imaginary friend be like. AND I SHALL. I just wrote : Someone who cared but knew well enough when enough was enough. Which is absolutely NUTS for me.</p>

    <p>I feel like it would help if I had a title for this book, but it always takes me forever. I need some cheerleaders! Who wants to write my novel for me??? Phew, hit my word goal just before midnight. I want 40k by tomorrow night. I&#8217;m surprised how well it went!</p>

    <p>Apparently I can&#8217;t write daily but in big doses! School has me slacking&#8230; I think I just broke a personal record. Started off on fire&#8230;fizzed out last week and worked on my fanfiction. I have my whole weekend planned to be caught up by Sunday, Monday tops.</p>

    <p>That&#8217;s gonna set my progress back. Suddenly, I know exactly how I&#8217;m going to use the Traveling Shovel of Death this year. Now I can start my day. Following along with someone doing a beta reading of my first nano for this year.</p>

    <p>I have discovered the secret to nighttime writing : SUPER LOUD METAL THAT WON&#8217;T LET YOU GET SLEEPY. Help me figure out what&#8230; I feel like this year won&#8217;t be that year&#8230; Also, I&#8217;ve initiated a mystery to which there is literally no solution. Wow,so far I&#8217;ve written 9,000 words about a single day. Do I really want to go through that again?</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been very busy last few days, but now I am back! I hit over my 2k words goal for the night. I think we might give me&#8230; It was tough, but I&#8217;m so proud.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m thanking god I skipped this year! I really have lost my way&#8230; I&#8217;m almost done. I&#8217;m still not sure what he&#8217;s going to do, I shall learn much about him. I guess there is always tomorrow. Okay, so long as I write 2,848 words every day from now on I will make my goal of 50K in 30 days!</p>

    <p>1,115 words for me. Let&#8217;s see if I can hit 26666 today! It would be so much easier if there were three of me. Just typed out a brief outline of my novel day16 into the process. I have a character who just used the word &#8220;poppycock&#8221; in a sentence. But I did make 266 new words.</p>

    <p>That was last week and I forgot to throw it away. After a night of nightmares and plotbunnies, I&#8217;m considering abandoning NaNo2 and go play with the new bunnies. I reached par tonight and my word count goal. I have invented a new word : &#8220;guardener&#8221;.</p>

    <p>I think this calls for some cake, yes? &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! I just hit over 25K!!!!! I complain too much!</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t known if I nailed it, but I wrote it. Today&#8217;s dilemma that I have to figure out how to solve : if my character&#8217;s reaction to recent events is petty. If you&#8217;re stumped, ask yourself,&#8217; What inspired me in the first place?</p>

    <p>Not bad, but I&#8217;m still quite behind. Day 13 is over, and I just passed 25000 words!!!!! If I can do 5.5k today (not unreasonable), I&#8217;ll be back on par! I don&#8217;t talk numbers&#8230; I was hoping it would be a little higher, but I will get there. Just finished a pivotal scene toward the end of my current WIP.</p>

    <p>&quot; If you don&#8217;t want to lose me, TELL me. Missed my word count tonight. Right&#8230;to taunt me. Thank you for all the support I&#8217;m getting out in Nanoland! I was needing a new twist and that may just be what I was looking for.</p>

    <p>I know exactly what I need to say&#8230; If my chance to go is tomorrow afternoon, then I suppose it&#8217;d do. This day has only existed for an hour and forty minutes and I&#8217;ve written 2571 words. Weird how most of my chapters are roughly 1,700 words&#8230;</p>

    <p>I just spelled &#8220;Uncharacteristically&#8221; correct on the first try. The 1K words I wrote yesterday, might be the biggest breakthrough I&#8217;ve had in over a year. So I know what to do with Luke. I call this&#8217; Ode to the empty bottle of red wine next to me&#8217;.</p>

    <p>I am DOING it! I wonder if all the passengers on my tram (aka captive audience) would like to hear about my manuscript. I don&#8217;t want to rush things, but i&#8217;m a competitive person. I wish life were like a MMORPG. I&#8217;ve got more than 45000 wrds to go yet, and only 2 wks to do that in.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m super behind. Still have the afternoon ahead of me. I JUST HIT 25K!!!!!!!!! Think I can do it? First day I&#8217;ve met the target word count.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m going to write like a maniac tonight. this is way more brutal than I thought it&#8217;d be, but I&#8217;m really proud of my consistency this year. Don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve cracked me because you haven&#8217;t! Lesson planning for the week is finished so now all my free time can be spent writing!</p>

    <p>Let myself get intimidated looking at the single page of research I did last month. I had to make up for falling short yesterday. Just wrote five paragraphs that I realized are definitely just for my benefit not the readers&#8217;. Letting the doubt roll off me, letting the questions and hesitations pass. Okay, then&#8230;getting my writing mojo back.</p>

    <p>Right, I will play ONE game of Heroes of the Storm, and then back to writing! Only 1 hour of downtime left before I start actual work again&#8230; What permission to suck means : I just assumed a desired characterization so I can keep writing. But I&#8217;m estimating about 20K more until the book is actually finished.</p>

    <p>Jumping between scenes means I get to kill a MC 1 minute then write a comical argument the next. Starting to rub out of steam, but I know the story well from the point I just wrote on. But I&#8217;m not getting lunch until I break 40K! &#8220; Winging it &#8221;didn&#8217;t work for me. I need to take a sip of tea to wash away the bad taste of my own writing.</p>

    <p>I am just under 10k. All my Wonder Woman comics&#8230;gone. A dress in my book does not stop a woman from adventuring. , but after five days of writing, I&#8217;m at just over 13,000 words. There&#8217;s something refreshing about the way the pile of notes grows smaller and smaller each time I complete a plot point.</p>

    <p>And when I open them, I expect there to be 860 more words in this document. I&#8217;m waiting for an email so you know what that means? She sounds like my daughter. But hey, you got me to talk to now! In a tank top and all I have is a dirty cardigan from my trunk.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m happy with that, and it puts me very firmly beyond the 33k line. &quot; I&#8217;ve always told Summer everything, but this is the one thing she can never know. I keep thinking I should have written another HF novel this year rather than adventure. OMG kill me. Would write more but : a) need to go to bed, b) my characters are being awkward and untalkative.</p>

    <p>Think I may have earned some sleep. I notice I can focus more when I have the tv on in the background, no sound. Not quite the 8k I hoped for, but I can see the ending now. So, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve got you beat in the slow department.</p>

    <p>going pretty well for my first year! Writing romance makes me feel extremely uncomfortable (in a good way). Reading the internet is not helping me get story written. Caught up with my anime : Check Started my school work : Check Music : Check Now time to get some writing done! Uh oh, I&#8217;m finally hitting the writers block. This has been a strange week but I am still up to 35800 words.</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll get done with this in time but I&#8217;m gonna have to try. Yes, I know it&#8217;s been a while. First time I&#8217;ve seen Dead Ringer, and quite enjoyed it.</p>

    <p>Wish me luck! Think I&#8217;ll choose drawing. Hoping I can stay awake long enough to write tonight. Just not my year and not the right project.</p>

    <p>Hopefully I can finish by this weekend! After writing for the majority of the afternoon, my first story for NaNo is COMPLETE at 50k! I&#8217;m at 29,000 words now! &quot; Straightforward is my middle name.</p>

    <p>That minor character I mentioned before is being a dirt bag now. I&#8217;m halfway done!!!! Because I think that&#8217;s what I am right now.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m going for 40K right now. I should be close to the middle of my story. I&#8217;m eating Pudding with a fork. With two hours to go, I crossed the halfway point before November 15. I&#8217;m beginning to use &#8220;My hair needs to be done&#8221; as an excuse to not write.</p>

    <p>Not what I expected on several fronts, but I&#8217;m going with the flow here. It&#8217;s from my phone, so we&#8217;ll see how the quality is. Going to try to start my NaNo time soon. Am I right?</p>

    <p>In a strange way, I feel comforted. I should be writing. This will b me tonight as well. Good news : word deficit is only at 8k Bad news : I have an 8k word deficit. I&#8217;m feeling a bit of Ray Bradbury sneaking in through my writing right now.</p>

    <p>I needed it! How much tea have I had today?? I have 5950 words to catch up on! I really needed to hear this.</p>

    <p>I would be tempted to do it again but I remember how I regretted it come Saturday&#8230; Need to keep doing this so I can catch up! Snuggling with my Onsie right now whilst doing some evening writing.</p>

    <p>Well this has gone totally off course but hey, I like it! But I really really really want to hit 25k. And I&#8217;m knitting again instead of writing. I&#8217;m ready to write some words.</p>

    <p>I hate when I write a really good line and then nothing&#8230; Hit my 10K for the day! I need a name for a disgraced, drunken lieutenant. I stopped at 22,222 words last nite. I&#8217;m not at par, but I&#8217;m close enough to make up the difference without too much pain. Right after I feed the cats.</p>

    <p>I should write, right? Ah, but now I knew. But I almost used it today. I went back to add a little to a chapter..and it became a whole new dramatic twist I wasn&#8217;t even expecting.</p>

    <p>I didn&#8217;t quite write 5k tonight, but I do have school in the morning&#8230; I&#8217;m at 22k or so right now. I will not give up! It&#8217;s going to be long and hard (for my characters, mainly). I felt elated and then remembered tomorrow is Monday and I have a day job. Not getting any writing done right now because SS4 exists and I&#8217;m watching footie.</p>

    <p>I will do this. The moment right after a big action scene is always hard for me&#8230; And my main character just pissed off the alien Queen. I hope my other Wrimos had a good count today.</p>

    <p>Alright, the coffee conundrum has been resolved, now I have a 15 mins break. Bit worried I&#8217;ll run out of plot before I finish 50k. I am super aware of my skeleton right now.</p>

    <p>I wrote 957 words in 30 minutes with Write or Die! Took me long enough, even with only one hand. But hey, I&#8217;m still not behind on my word count.</p>

    <p>I am excited about my most recent scene. Apparently I can write 1000 words in 25 mins when I&#8217;ve got a big target word count to hit. I went from, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to write tonight,&#8221; to &quot;I wrote 2,400 words. I&#8217;m sitting so low in my chair that I&#8217;m using a travel pillow. I like big word counts and I cannot lie, all you other writers can deny&#8230;</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been sitting at my desk for too long! So if you need me today, I&#8217;ll be at the Park Slope Starbucks until that&#8217;s done&#8230; only hit 1,322, but I&#8217;m still on track. Okay, now it&#8217;s time to get serious, the coffee is kicking in and my fingers are itching to write! Halfway to my own personal goal!</p>

    <p>I know I&#8217;m still far FAR behind. I may hibernate in front if the fireplace and catch up on word count today. Now that my weeks is over I should probably write again&#8230; I ran out of fun sized kit kats.</p>

    <p>I know I&#8217;m still far FAR behind. Can&#8217;t seem to silence the editor in me. I&#8217;ve got Thanksgiving to host, so I gotta git&#8217; er done. Because my MC is worth it.</p>

    <p>Need to ponder my next move since I strayed from outline. Not a single doughnut in the story, but I did have one for breakfast! Determined to hit 25 000 tonight, but I&#8217;ve been sat at computer for too long and need a break. Not as much as I wanted, but good enough to sleep on it!</p>

    <p>Work, school, packing and trying to write is literally draining me&#8230; One is full of coffee to get me through the next few thousand words. I wasn&#8217;t feeling well the last few days so I took some time off from writing to sleep (like a jerk) but I&#8217;m back in action. You might be easier if my family could take care of themselves! &#8230;and I will marry very well some day, just like her.</p>

    <p>Writing fiction always leads me to listen to whatever music my characters might be listening to. I wonder how many words an NFL game could yield? my story is actually 74569 words long now. I am thinking of starting at : 30. Have just realised that my fic isn&#8217;t going to go the whole 50k.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m not writing at all this weekend so next week is gonna suck, but I CAN DO THIS. Slowly realizing that all of my male characters have younger sisters and all of my female characters have older brothers. I really want to know how this book ends but I have finish writing it first UGH.</p>

    <p>I did 2 marathon sessions and increased word count. I have done 1013 words so I am allowed lunch right? I&#8217;m so far behind on my word count, it&#8217;s not even funny. Whatever you do, don&#8217;t ask me what my story is about. I declare this day a success.</p>

    <p>And I&#8217;ve lost all my plot notes&#8230; I&#8217;m going to pretend that it&#8217;s okay I&#8217;m still in my pjamas and it&#8217;s nearly 12. Sent my 2nd novel off to a literary agent. Fatigued from work and cat decided I played with the keyboard long enough. I guess I should just be glad I&#8217;m not more behind than I am though. The NSA must be wondering what the hell I&#8217;m doing with what I&#8217;ve been researching. Keep squicking myself with the sex scene I&#8217;m writing, because I&#8217;ve accidentally made vampire dick kind of gross.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m determined to get there tonight. My MCs demand I get every detail just right, the darlings. So everyone please excuse me for the bottle(s) of wine next to my writing desk. Oh my God Becky, look at her word count. More importantly, brought my total up to 23.1K.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m consistently a day behind. I got 2,000 words written tonight! I&#8217;ll catch up over the weekend. Tomorrow night is queued up for writing and I should be fresh.</p>

    <p>but it&#8217;s also the first time I haven&#8217;t given up once behind. (have I said month a lot in this tweet?) I wrote 2171 words today and have written 20,467 total. At 7700 words, but I&#8217;m writing and the story is pouring out. just about to try out my new standing desk. 3969 words so far today and I feel I can still write more.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m done with my 50 000 words! Sometimes when I am writing, I forget what&#8217;s actually happening out there in the real world. My problem with NaNoWriMo is I always get a million other book ideas and have to write them at the same time. I just had an exciting jail break with explosions.</p>

    <p>And my brain. I&#8217;m kind of behind. This cold is trying to keep me from adding more words. I have officially hit The Wall. Get ready to hear a lot of Livin&#8217; on a Prayer jokes because I am halfway there!</p>

    <p>I swear it felt like far more than the minimum this time as I was doing it, though. One of them surprised me with her rage. I somehow managed to reach my word count for today after getting no sleep last night and running around all day. I just opened my blinds so I could look at the snow, which means I&#8217;ll definitely not be getting anymore writing done today. Even if I don&#8217;t finish by November 30, it&#8217;s at least inspired me to start something new.</p>

    <p>Because you know I&#8217;m all about the word counts, bout the word counts, no edits&#8230; I should probably have done that first but oh well.</p>

    <p>Wish me luck! I&#8217;d call it a success. I feel super behind, but I need 2273 words a day to finish on time. Btw, that elusive turkey evaded my bumbling hunters&#8230;Now I gots to decide on &#8220;what&#8221; my buried treasure shall be. I think it&#8217;s worth it.</p>

    <p>Wonder if I can knock out 3K to break 30K? I have not been able to catch up to word count at all this month so far. I have been writing every single day and I&#8217;m constantly ahead. So I passed 50k about seven hours ago. Here&#8217;s a fun experiment : I have no idea what this scene will accomplish or how it will play out, but I&#8217;m just gonna press PLAY.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll be at 25K once the evening&#8217;s through. The hour before I need to go to bed : the only time lately my writing muses are active AND I&#8217;m interested in reading. I&#8217;m still way behind, but making progress and it feels great!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m halfway finished with writing a novel! I KEEP SLIPPING INTO 1ST PERSON WHEN I SHOULD BE WRITING IN 3RD!!! If anyone wants to join me, please do!</p>

    <p>Every time I write a scene where a couple I ship fights or breaks up I get kind of emotional. Dumped my MC in the oubliette, now I have to figure out how to get him out. And I&#8217;ve killed the battery on my laptop after 3 and a half hours of writing and only have 1.3k words to show for it.</p>

    <p>I am so stuck on a plot point. Not that I&#8217;m anywhere near halfway done with my novel. The writing I&#8217;ve engaged in over recent months, specifically the novel, have been hollow. I&#8217;m at just over 19k. Only 5k more to make my Saturday goal.</p>

    <p>Sum1 just hit 50k and I&#8217;m only at, like, 12k. It&#8217;s going to take more than cold fingers to stop me. It won&#8217;t last, but I love it!</p>

    <p>Jotting things down in my calendar, I realized I have only two little weeks left to finish a novel. Yup only four short scenes to write and I&#8217;ll be finished with plot. Which means, for the first time this month, I&#8217;m on par for 150k by the end of the month!</p>

    <p>New goal : just beat my word count last year lol. Early today I wrote myself into a rut&#8230;. Who is up for sprinting with me? I plan on writing today&#8230; Starting to have a little faith that I&#8217;m going to get those 50,000 written.</p>

    <p>On a major spree since I had to skip a few days because of work! I am taking a break, my finger is bothering me. I&#8217;m going to have to do some big word days! I&#8217;ve just reached my first 50k words!</p>

    <p>Everything I try to do&#8230; It took me way too long but I am at 37k. When I believe I&#8217;m writing it for me and only me, it&#8217;s always better!</p>

    <p>I need another brain. I broke 40K yesterday so my WC so far is 40,329! I&#8217;m behind right now, but not for long. Writing tip : Sometimes when stuck, I draw simple stick figure scene. I certainly get practice at it!</p>

    <p>finally starting to love writing my novel, after 21 thousand words, hooray! I have a confession to make. I recommend. I&#8217;m confusing myself so there&#8217;s no hope for any potential future readers.</p>

    <p>Almost to the scene I envisioned during the first day of planning! &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! At 35,541 words and I get to reintroduce a character that was briefly in another book. Some time over the last few days my novel has replaced my thesis as the longest work I&#8217;ve ever written.</p>

    <p>&#8230;Yeah, I would&#8217;ve preferred to be writing. I was looking for 40K this weekend but I seem to have lost it under a carpet. Made me laugh and dive into my work. I need you now. I do need some sleep. Maybe if I focused more on the story as a whole instead of a daily word count I would get more accomplished.</p>

    <p>my new story is about girls who fall in love of after meeting in a museum. Hell, maybe I can finish all 50k this weekend. I couldn&#8217;t sleep tonight. I should be writing but I&#8217;m in sugar coma.</p>

    <p>Day 16 : rough morning, however, I did manage 1376 words today. Got up to 21,066 words, so hit my 2k goal. Now I have to go peel some eggs. I love that moment when something new in the story clicks.</p>

    <p>Now I know. slowly bringing my word count to heel, 15,500 words, should really call it a night, good luck fellow Wrimos!! Cousin is asleep, finally sitting down to write my last 2000 words for today. No infomercials puts a wrinkle in my plan. I&#8217;m loving my secondary characters more and more.</p>

    <p>Had to meet my word quota for today and I did. I Rock! But it&#8217;s a mess I&#8217;m proud of. I&#8217;m using this for my writing portfolio to get into a PHD program. Sometimes I think she is a lot like me, then she does something like this.. I can catch up, right?</p>

    <p>I beat it up and left it for dead in a ditch. I am 2,500 words from 50k. I&#8217;m doing a 15 minute sprint at : 00 if anyone want to join! Think I just made some new adventurous, insecure, creative best friends!</p>

    <p>&quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! Encouraging myself by wearing my new Wonder Woman onesie to write. Less than 5K words until I reach 50k total. Think I just made some new adventurous, insecure, creative best friends!</p>

    <p>Oh my head. I just hope they&#8217;re all in the right order. Needed to name a place in my WIP. To kill or not to kill, that is the writing dilemma I am having right now.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m an outliner myself, but always curious about how others do it. When has my life become so Rock&#8217;n&#8217;Roll? Today I wrote 2620 words and have a total of 24,785. I&#8217;m ahead at 31.5k words but I still want to type today, even though I have taken a weekend trip to see family in New Hampshire. I&#8217;m stopping in the middle of a good part so I can pick it right up tomorrow.</p>

    <p>I had to use a bigger binder clip on my WIP (work in progress) this a.m. That&#8217;s a good sign, right? And realized my lead character may need a new job. If I write another 520 words before going to bed, that&#8217;ll be a 5K day. I must be doing a good job because I&#8217;m making myself sick. Spent a lot of time looking up information about electric violins for my story.</p>

    <p>Awake earlier than I need to be today. Considering I missed the first half for work, I&#8217;m pleased at how the mid month marathon went! but then I didn&#8217;t write a single word yesterday&#8230; I&#8217;ve now used up all of my backlog. I am at fakey fakey right now.</p>

    <p>Lucky for me I was well ahead. Coffee and then I&#8217;ll start writing for real? Well, I have given myself quite some pickles to sort out in this story. and we&#8217;ll see where I can go from there. Day long class again today, but if I write before, and during lunch, and tonight, I think I can break 25K. It&#8217;s getting harder for me.</p>

    <p>My chapter went places I totally didn&#8217;t expect tonight. Writing in the kitchen is my new favorite thing. Well, I didn&#8217;t cry, but that scene left me feeling a little empty and I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m ready to continue&#8230; Listen to me! I&#8217;ll just have a quick scroll through my Twitter feed&#8230;it will help motivate me.</p>

    <p>I will drag these words out if it kills me. I suppose it&#8217;s not really in the spirit of the challenge to type the same curse word 50,000 times? Yes, yes I would.) Day 15 final count since I hit a wall. 33,011 and I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m on a roll or not, but I&#8217;ve certainly climbed over a hurdle. &#8220; Gee, I sure wish the author had described the main character&#8217;s hair colour, &#8221;said no reader ever.</p>

    <p>Lucky I am a day ahead. 1800 words and I&#8217;ve crossed 18000. Im behind been busy so back to work I go!</p>

    <p>I just reached 25k, yay for me! I&#8217;ve made it to 8193 and still might have a few more in me. Put my head down, kicked book butt today, and got caught back up to where I wanted to be. I can do this! If I can stay conscious, I might be able to get to 30K tonight after the kids are in bed.</p>

    <p>For someone 15 days late into things, I&#8217;m surprisingly ahead of my own schedule. I&#8217;m being very antisocial and writing during breaks and stuff. I can do it! I should probably write something. If I had written one word fewer, I would be 11111 words behind right now. If I stay up late to write tonight, I&#8217;ll be too tired to clean the house tomorrow.</p>

    <p>&quot; Wait, what IS my character&#8217;s middle name? I find myself writing middle grade to young adult romance with a magical twist. I just created a character named Johnny Mathis for no real reason, and now my book has a soundtrack. Right now, my characters are discussing why free range unicorns are banned.</p>

    <p>My greatest failure as a writer may be the inability to hang on to a flash drive to save my life. Maybe I&#8217;m inspired to add a few more&#8230; But I want to. Got a big scene coming up, maybe I can get to 17,000 before too long&#8230;! Word does pretty much everything I need for writing this stupid book on my iPad.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m only 19K words away from finishing my second book. My previous novel was at a dead end, so I decided to start a new one. Not bad, not my goal, but I&#8217;ll take it.</p>

    <p>knocked out about 800 words this morning, which isn&#8217;t bad considering my brain is not awake yet. This always seems to happen around 14,000 for me. I made ca. And now I&#8217;m crying (metaphorically) because I&#8217;m not even at half of what I should have at this point.</p>

    <p>Well, I&#8217;ve taken a break&#8230;.so maybe it&#8217;s time to get back to writing? The story is coming out nicely for my next visual novel a BXB one. Well, 2 and a half, I need to revise a part of the third chapter again. There, did it even though I didn&#8217;t want to do it! I&#8217;m going to have FUN.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m definitely taking some vacation time next Nov. No longer have it in me to do this. Might squeeze in some words if I&#8217;m lucky. I am new to writing for the most part, and October was bad month.. &quot; at my manuscript, but it was totally warranted. Today my writing goal is 3 days worth of word counts.</p>

    <p>I talked to myself in the novel to end it out. Okay really tho, Im restraining myself from screaming because I dont wanna freak out my parents. I made the 30,000 word mark and am currently in need of some motivation, preferably in the form of licorice. Okay, weekend of the Night of Writing Dangerously, here I come! Cut me, Mick. Most of me wants to go home and pass out.</p>

    <p>had a day off from writing today because of a hangover (which I&#8217;m blaming on other people). Sorry I have to stop my 15 minute word sprints to eat a candy cane it&#8217;s important. Who votes I turn this into Majora&#8217;s Mask fanfic? Now I can crawl off to bed happy and let my tired brain rest. I&#8217;m full of encouragement today.</p>

    <p>I can&#8217;t exactly stop NOW, can I? Life interfered the last few days but I am back on track with writing my novel. An Underwood yielding muse is holding me. &quot; I am writing a NOVEL in THIRTY days! I&#8217;ve forgotten to add most of the quirky quirks I assigned to my characters. Which is good, since I likely won&#8217;t be home from work&#8217; til after midnight&#8230;</p>

    <p>Thinking I&#8217;ll head to bed now. Does somebody want to give me some ideas for my novel&#8217; cause I&#8217;m fresh out. Let&#8217;s see if I can get to 50k by the end of the day. These moments are rare for me.</p>

    <p>&#8220; &#8221;Nothing, my dear Frodo. Didn&#8217;t write much as I hoped. Got 600 words done before my laptop decided to do an arbitrary update and restart. OK, I&#8217;m ready to write.</p>

    <p>You know what, I&#8217;ve written enough that if I wrote nothing tomorrow I&#8217;d still be on track to finish. Don&#8217;t know how much writing I&#8217;ll get done. Last night, thanks to a fake Ebola scare, I had to work 15 hours. Now I have to play Magnum PI in the background on Netflix to honor Glen A. Larson. I&#8217;m really feeling like I need some light weight entertainment.</p>

    <p>&quot; I really, truly love this word. Who wants to join me for a word sprint in 8 minutes? So bummed I lost a bunch of work. However much of this I realize will be cut, it&#8217;s forced me to start writing prose. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll get back ahead.</p>

    <p>Concerned because thought was short on words but found out I&#8217;m good. Just about made it at 1024 but I&#8217;m set for the scene! Heading back to the crawl I abandoned last night. I didn&#8217;t count the time&#8217; cause I was doing other stuff too, like eating breakfast.</p>

    <p>Jimmy Fallon is trying to get my attention. Does it count as a sex scene if my character is getting off on murdering a room full of murder fetishists? I must have gotten enough sleep,&#8217; cause my brain is fleshing out subplots and characters faster than I can get it all down! Just passed 37k and I&#8217;m steadily getting plugged back into my novel after a few days without writing. I&#8217;m really falling in love with my novel.</p>

    <p>One of my characters just decided to come out (both to me and the other characters). My 5 y.o. daughter told me : &quot;Mom, I&#8217;m going to be a writer like you when I grow up. Being a lazy ass writer right now and not working on my words. I wrote 800 words tonight, which is good enough for me.</p>

    <p>I am DOING it! Tonight is another night when I can&#8217;t stay up late because I have to get up early tomorrow. Sweet mother of Celestia, I can&#8217;t believe I did it.</p>

    <p>I have to stop and make a character list, it feels rather apropos. Sometimes, it triggers &#8220;real&#8221; movie in my head. Princess heads out to avoid my stalker, there wasn&#8217;t really a tonight thing. I need 6000 words to catch up to tomorrow&#8217;s pace. Didn&#8217;t write yesterday, glad I hit 20k early!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m just along for the ride. Positive feedback from my critique group? Not sure if nothing&#8217;s actually happened in this novel yet or if it feels that way cuz I know there are THINGS to come. First one I&#8217;ve liked this much since I published Jute.</p>

    <p>Just another 3.5k words left today to reach my target. I started a scene with 17 people in it and spent my time coming up with their names. Why can&#8217;t I go back to my first year of NaNo where I was happy writing 4k on cleaning the house just to make up words?</p>

    <p>There is just not enough tea in this world for me to consume in order to write 25k words tonight. I am really liking MS Office Online right now. I&#8217;m spent. I&#8217;m not quite at a third of my goal for the day. Oh I&#8217;ve forgotten the joy of writing the mind of someone who gets to hear the harder styles for the first time..</p>

    <p>Including a super fun car chase in my novel, why?! I am DOING it! So apparently, after having no job for a month and a half I am now too busy for everything. only about 500 words today, which is not enough but at least it gets me past 24k.</p>

    <p>Lovin&#8217; the chapter I&#8217;m on, and still super excited about this story. My story took a major turn when my antagonist was supposed to defeat someone, but he was just too strong. I&#8217;m on a roll. Much too exhausted now to make up the 1k difference in drafts, but I&#8217;ll write extra tomorrow. At the very least I&#8217;ll get as far as I can, and that&#8217;s something.</p>

    <p>I am killing it right now! Saying &#8220;I lost a day due to helping my mother with the internet&#8221; is a valid excuse for not reaching your word count, right? It&#8217;s 10 pm and I need to go to bed in 30 minutes due to an early morning. but I&#8217;m finally getting a chance to at least say&#8230;</p>

    <p>no grungy diner yet, but just give me time. What I really ought to do is try to write more. I have a wide variety of noveling snacks tonight. I&#8217;m behind, but not impossibly so. I&#8217;m catching up, I might be able to get back on track.</p>

    <p>I need to clean my house. I got to over 15k and refuse to beat a dead horse right now. it&#8217;s very unlike my usual stuff. It&#8217;s a sequel to The Wizard of Oz, wherein I give Oz a dark, despotic, steampunk twist.</p>

    <p>Maybe if I ignore it, it&#8217;ll go away. However, I am fast becoming an night owl. Also, trying to find my gloves and my car keys&#8230; Think I just made some new adventurous, insecure, creative best friends!</p>

    <p>It seems like I start writing later every night, but at least I&#8217;m getting it done every day. Incentive to keep going, or an excuse to put my feet up and open a beer? I have a lot of catching up to do because I was already behind. I just figured out what Part 2 will entail and I am so excited to watch it unfold.</p>

    <p>I need to find a way to recapture that inspiration and motivation I had. I&#8217;ve got a mug full of tea and 7000 words to catch up. Today I have really struggled to focus on writing, I think it&#8217;s cause I haven&#8217;t written in two days, but it is frustrating. I should have started using Write or Die a long long time ago. I just typed 20k words, and my original goal for this month is 25k.</p>

    <p>I managed just under 1800 words tonight. Caught myself with my eyes closed and fingers moving. I&#8217;m unbelievably excited.</p>

    <p>I used to come up with so many excuses for being &#8220;unable&#8221; to write. I just finished writing the most intense part of my novel. Characters have taken this so far off the beaten path, I am forced to declare pantser status. It has taken me this long to figure out where my story begins. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m a superhero.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m going to need a beta reader like it&#8217;s going out of style. I&#8217;m so freaking excited. I&#8217;m on a roll! The core of my novel is bittersweet love scenes with the protagonists interspersed with gnarly hate sex from the villains. Can I write my last 400 words before midnight? I&#8217;m really excited about this project.</p>

    <p>30k in and I&#8217;ve changed and moved around so much on my original outline that now it resembles a football play chart. For the first time ever, I am writing a novel in a linear fashion. Noooo computer don&#8217;t die, I&#8217;m almost done writing! Even if I don&#8217;t finish by November 30, it&#8217;s at least inspired me to start something new. I fell reeeeaaally far behind this week.</p>

    <p>I think a ninja plot bunny came in, stole my thoughts, and left me to crash into a brick wall. A much needed boost in my word count! Two days of zero writing due to hangovers I had to make up for this morning with a mammoth push. Well, that&#8217;s a wrap on Day 12 and I&#8217;ve slipped over the 20,000 barrier! Luckily I&#8217;m almost at 50,000 words.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m really happy with the progress and trying not to think of the long tunnel of editing to come. I should be going for halfway but given the exhaustion and frustration of my life&#8230;5k beats giving up completely. I think my brain is destroyed by too much writing lately. I&#8217;m not that far behind thankfully.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve got an amnesiac telepath being hunted by clockwork wolves. YOU&#8217;RE GODDAMN RIGHT I DIDI! I swam for the swim team in high school (poorly). My current wordcount is 22222 and this is extremely pleasing to me. Oh my word this novel just got exciting!</p>

    <p>Maybe I should get a puppy. Excuse me while I worshipfully kiss my own feet. I&#8217;ll meet yall on the other side of insanity where the buckets of ice cream are. I&#8217;m gonna sprint again at : 45 till : 00!!! I&#8217;m super scientific.</p>

    <p>I bet I&#8217;m almost done for the day. I am so excited. I think I wouldn&#8217;t have stood up at all today if it weren&#8217;t for the endless cycle of coffee and needing to pee. Am I crazy for genuinely considering starting over? Do I think logically that I will be able to hit 20K today?</p>

    <p>And I&#8217;m having so much fun, too! Why is it that my characters give such great advice, yet I can barely be bothered to put pants on of a morning? It&#8217;s working out for me. Less than 500 words left til&#8217; I reach my word goal for NaNoWriMo! My weeks wear me down.</p>

    <p>I know what goes down. Almost half way there and I finally figured out how to put the scifi in my scifi novel. I can do this. Right now is one of those times you probably wouldn&#8217;t want to look at my search history. &#8220; &#8221;Oh, I thought I was being original.</p>

    <p>I am excited. I may still be behind on my writing, but I just surpassed 15k words, and it felt pretty damn satisfying, if I do say so meself. I&#8217;ve written 750 words, so it&#8217;s not a complete loss. writing down my story is getting urgent.</p>

    <p>I lost the handwritten pages I had to write while my computer was down. My goal is to finish before the 26th, so I can have a long and relaxing birthday weekend. Thanks to the very helpful LA Lemurs I hit 5k for the day and am back on track with 25k words. 500 more words and I will allow myself to go buy some new Magic cards.</p>

    <p>I got a ton down tonight. This one&#8217;s so very different than all of my previous NaNo Novels. I did it! Hmm, 23336 isn&#8217;t quite where I&#8217;d hoped to be, but it&#8217;s moving in the right direction. I&#8217;m back to do more writing!!</p>

    <p>I can write 422 more words, right? I should write, right? I am DOING it! Hard to believe I&#8217;ve trudged this far. I need to put down 2,000 words today and I am a bit stuck.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m going to try to reach 12k before end of tonight. This being true, I&#8217;ve raised procrastination to an art form. I gave it an entire night to try. Cool idea I think.</p>

    <p>Okay, I have 34,059 words right now and I&#8217;m going to hit 35,000 before I go to bed in an hour. And I did it! I feel like jumping up and down.</p>

    <p>Time&#8217;s up, my sprintlings! I can catch up, right? I&#8217;m so tired, woke up so early, but I have&#8230; I hope tomorrow is more creative thanks to the night off.</p>

    <p>That isn&#8217;t exactly where I wanted to be at this point in the 30 Day Challenge, but hopefully I&#8217;ll have some writing spurts! Would it be wrong to use the pen name Nick Sparks for a story about my love of a small personal computer entitled &#8220;The Netbook&#8221;? Who ever thought I&#8217;d get a new scene idea from putting a new trash bag in the bin??? I&#8217;ve literally been writing all day and I think that&#8217;s fantastic.</p>

    <p>Need a break free of characters demanding &#8220;me time. Might even be able to spend a little time with my family! How long can I drag on a conversation between two minor characters? Just found out that one of my students took &#8221;turn off your inner editor&quot; to mean he didn&#8217;t need any punctuation.</p>

    <p>totally lost track of time, I&#8217;m screwed on sleep now lol. I have 0 plot. I do mean things to fictional people.</p>

    <p>not my usual writing, but a pretty good base going on. I love writing new fiction first thing in the morning. The words won&#8217;t show up if I&#8217;m doing other things. Oh, and PS : I hit 20K. Good thing I don&#8217;t have a class&#8217; til ten.</p>

    <p>After four days of epic writers block, I managed to get 6,468 words down tonight. During that paragraph I get the most intense ice pick head ache I&#8217;ve gotten in weeks. Still about 3500 words behind but if I can hit 19K tonight I will feel a little better. This being true, I&#8217;ve raised procrastination to an art form.</p>

    <p>get in my daily 2k words without effort, that&#8217;d be great, thx. What if everytime I would breathe, 1,500 words appear on the screen, That would be a pretty useful super power right now. I have no clue how anal sex feels like, nor what to do. Just realized that one of my characters left home and left his aforementioned cell phone behind. As for my half of this twitter&#8217;s Novel&#8230;</p>

    <p>I love it when a writing session, which started out rocky, turns into a success. Pretty confidant I&#8217;ll finish! &#8220; Yeah, I like Mardock Scramble &#8221;said the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 7pm brings me to 1225. I&#8217;m in the home stretch, but I&#8217;m not sure there are 10,000 words left in this project. I&#8217;ve been here 2 and a half hours.</p>

    <p>Regaining my comfortable groove. I&#8217;ve just reached my first 50k words! I will double my word count by Monday. I will catch up! 1778 in on the manuscript, 0 in on the 2 papers I have due tomorrow night. I hit fifty thousand words in just half a month.</p>

    <p>Last year on day 14 I did 9500 in a single night. I managed to lose about an hour&#8217;s worth of writing. Last night, I had one of those &#8220;my book sucks&#8221; moments. At what wordcount will I stop? I had a pretty crappy day, so it&#8217;s time write a really great short!</p>

    <p>(Fortunately I am ahead anyway&#8230;) I&#8217;m a procrastinator, because I am just now beginning to write on my day off. I&#8217;ve gone to previous chapters and extended scenes.</p>

    <p>Just gonna keep going&#8217; til I drop. Gosh, I&#8217;m loving this book so much. It&#8217;s scary how much coffee helps me write. I mean, seriously, I did 4K words today which is fantastic for me. I never know where to fit them in my story.</p>

    <p>I think I&#8217;m still slightly reeling from that wordcount. I&#8217;ve settled on calling the town Brownwell&#8217;s Burrow for now after it&#8217;s founder Cecil Bronwell. never thought i&#8217;d fit in a lion AND crocodile attack into my story.</p>

    <p>The coffee I had an hour and a half ago is not sticking with me. I had an idea for the next chapter of my story but then realized it wouldn&#8217;t fit in with the timeline. I&#8217;m freezing. No I fucking won&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve passed 25,000 words on my novel, and there was a huge reveal in the plot today.</p>

    <p>Threw down 1,999 words in the last hour, bringing me to 2,504 total. I ran out of fun sized kit kats. Holy crap, I may have just come up with a really interesting twist for my story. 1000 words left to write for today, and hopefully I can get it done before 11. I&#8217;m at 27.8K ish right now!</p>

    <p>I have needs too! I&#8217;m at the halfway point for the average Wrimo. I know that writing 907 words when I am depressed and cannot put 5 thoughts together is huge&#8230;</p>

    <p>I know, I&#8217;m making no sense, but I&#8217;m super excited about exploding plot points! Still behind, but I&#8217;m catching up! That was me jumping up and down as I figured out my next plot twist. I am about half way done with the novel.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll be teaching 3rd grade tomorrow and then going to my other job all night. Also, I seem to have dialogue and forward momentum, which is always useful. Yes, I&#8217;m that far behind. Twice now I&#8217;ve found myself typing scenes from my novel into my emails. Really pleased I managed to do this much!</p>

    <p>i have written half of my 50K words&#8230; This year may be a bust for me but still trying. I have made a deal with myself : if I hit the 25, 000 mark by midnight tonight, I can buy Super Smash Bros tomorrow!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m going to print this half puppy tomorrow. My bottle of imagination is a quarter down the bottom, and my jar of motivation, is dry. I am now caught up and moving ahead of target schedule. Conflict of dates, had to make certain my story fit time frame. But that&#8217;s fine by me.</p>

    <h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>I am so far behind! I am a LOT of words behind and am now considering changing my main idea. Muse don&#8217;t fail me now!</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s 14 minutes past my bedtime and I&#8217;m just starting writing for today. I can still write longhand with right. I have one little green bar again. I&#8217;m having serious writer&#8217;s block and have only written a paragraph. Yesterday&#8217;s break was exactly what I needed!</p>

    <p>Seeing a few Tweets pass my way on it. I&#8217;ve hit my half way point. So far totalling 6380 words today, and bringing me past the halfway mark at 26 801 words! I just almost wrote NaNoWriMo instead of November in my notebook for the date. First time I&#8217;ve written a fight scene this detailed.</p>

    <p>Today I will not let myself down. Wonder what I. I made so much progress yesterday and now I can&#8217;t get anything done, especially writing because of this stupid headache. I kind of hate to ruin that. Had a brief hitch just before halfway, like I usually do, but I&#8217;m still enjoying my novel!</p>

    <p>I wrote so few words, I didn&#8217;t even add them up and add it to my word count. Of course I have writers block, of freaking course, less than 3,000 words from the minimum and I can&#8217;t think. I hate when I try to butt in to my own story and my characters reject the idea. Realizing at 16,000 words in that I have to rework my entire outline? Luckily I have the control.</p>

    <p>It seems I&#8217;m 87 words down on yesterday. I hit just over 30,000 words on the new novel today. I&#8217;m down. He&#8217;ll thank me later, right?</p>

    <p>&#8217; She was lazy and stupid and although she said she loved teaching, I never saw her heart for the work. That&#8217;s my word count. I am just having trouble getting motivated to write today. A quick bike ride and my 6pm sprint has me up to 1085 for the day.</p>

    <p>I will write during my down time at work and when I get home. Can I stop working and bathing and all that normal stuff during November? I think it&#8217;s time to wind down. It always turns out fine and yet I put it off as long as I can.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m due to finish 25 Nov. For NaNo, I&#8217;m attempting to crank out an anthology. I know I&#8217;m a day behind, but I finally broke 20k! I&#8217;m pretty sure the words I am writing right now don&#8217;t make sense.</p>

    <p>So much harder than a 10k day for me! The only thing I am struggling with is getting inside my female protagonist&#8217;s head. So tired I&#8217;m actually dizzy. Got more words in the bank today already than I did the whole of yesterday&#8230;</p>

    <p>I sat down to write a battle scene and I have 500 words describing the armies. Ugh, Just reread my hook chapter and realized that it is a reasonable scenario for 49 states. I am going no where, I will be by your side until we both go down fighting. Who wants to do a 40 min writing sprint with me at 7:30pm?</p>

    <p>If I keep writing beats instead of beast, people are gonna think my werewolf is a dj during full moons. Today I am running a fever, swollen throat, hacking bronchitis. This is one of those crappy days when I want to quit. Not sure where I&#8217;m going next. I&#8217;m ahead of todays target so time to get to half way stage.. I am not a total failure, damnit! Still going slow but I mean technically I&#8217;m taking a few days &#8220;off&#8221;&#8230;</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m so far behind, but at least I know what I&#8217;m writing. Can I make up for it with 15k in less than 10 hours? Taking a day off (although not by choice) has affected my mojo&#8230; I think that&#8217;s good enough.</p>

    <p>Woohoo, I&#8217;m less than 1,000 words away from 30k! Starting my writing at 10:30 pm : not a good idea. &#8220; I&#8217;m not really talking about you, am me &#8221;. I just wrote 4500 words. Super excited with today&#8217;s word count of 2869 I managed after working and doing some house work too.</p>

    <p>I just had that writer moment where I wrote a passage and when I read it back I thought &quot;Holy shit. Ok, so NOW my story is more romance, with a dash of psychological horror. It&#8217;s not a month of novelling madness if I don&#8217;t break out the Atonement soundtrack for a few days of writing. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s already half over. I&#8217;m pretty sure cookies will boost my word count.</p>

    <p>Afk the vacuum is calling to be fair, the plot easy, because I like his face. I am a lady. Procrastinated for half the day and now I&#8217;m about halfway through today&#8217;s goal. I&#8217;ve passed the 25K mark, half way!</p>

    <p>I really, really don&#8217;t want to write today. I am seriously having the best day of writing since day 1. I&#8217;m knee deep in my novel but still behind. Less than 300 words away from my target today. But I&#8217;m excited.</p>

    <p>Too much fun playing with &quot;Ginnie me! I am 496 words away from the 25,000 word mark so off I go to hit that goal! I might not blog any more this month :(GARGH. I am currently at a little over 15k. I&#8217;m a little bit past 25,000 words, so I&#8217;m on track.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m gonna get 50k by tomorrow night. I need a bullitin board to connect all the dots with tacs and string! I&#8217;m about a whole section behind when it comes to posting these excerpts. I am posting no more pictures through this weekend instead I&#8217;m going to go be productive with other things. With all the trips I&#8217;ve taken the past few weeks, I haven&#8217;t had time to turn on my home computer.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ll have to hunt down some of these bands. Billy Collins opens for me at 10. She wrote 25,000 words in a month and I have trouble writing like 10&#8230; Also I really don&#8217;t want to write anything. Pretty sure a bit of the 2k that I wrote today is more of an info dump (and less of a book), but this is so much fun!</p>

    <p>I feel like he&#8217;s staring everyone down. I am DOING it! In rewritting and all that shit I now have 8,000 words. It&#8217;s as if my fingers have been taken over by some unknown force. Ok, I&#8217;ve been busy with everything else all day.</p>

    <p>I celebrated by eating too many golden Oreos and ribbon candy. Hopefully tomorrow I will get a lot of words! No funny lines, but my iPhone keeps changing the word &#8220;scrunchie&#8221; to &quot;acrubchie. I need to finish this novel so I can stop being a little stress ball about it. I&#8217;m mean it really grinds my fucking gears.</p>

    <p>I thought I was going to slow down after reaching 50K yesterday. At 16591 words, I have clawed my way back to only 5000 words behind schedule! Here&#8217;s a sample of my outline. Writing this book feels like the most important thing in my life right now.</p>

    <p>So far so good and I&#8217;m ahead. Ugh I need to ice my wrists. I have absconded to a secluded corner of a local coffee house sans child or spouse for some serious writing. Tomorrow might be hard due to work, but Monday I&#8217;m aiming for a 5000 day!!</p>

    <p>I think women are interesting characters, because their stories are rarely told. I need motivation to write. 30,137 words so far&#8230;and I&#8217;m not even half way through my novel. I&#8217;m at that stage in my novel where I think the whole thing is a bad idea.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve got a few big things planned! I&#8217;m so excited. Only 12.5k behind my goal now, so I am closing that gap. How could I modify this just slightly? Hitting a word count milestone should surround me with a halo of light.</p>

    <p>I mean her word count is so big Look! I like the voice of my MC. My laptop battery took a shit without telling me of it&#8217;s plans to do so. but I will work harder then I bet have. I love my new heroine.</p>

    <p>I mean they are fictional, after all. Was planning on writing during M&#8217;s nap but my sinuses just imploded. I&#8217;m stuck at home, I&#8217;d like to know what I&#8217;m missing. The words are rolling, 733 words so far, but I am so far behind! Think I just made some new adventurous, insecure, creative best friends!</p>

    <p>and when I say double figures, I mean 10000, not like 12. Wonder how much further I can get before it gets here. Now am I dead. I beat it up and left it for dead in a ditch. Let&#8217;s see if I can manage to scrounge up a quick 2K.</p>

    <p>Lol jk I still only have 300&#8230; I&#8217;m at 2k now and headed for 5k today! A little later than usual, but I did it! I&#8217;ve been lazy today.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m really starting to feel like I&#8217;m going to fail this whole thing. I might be getting a little too autobiographical as I make my char laugh at the servings per container label on a bag of chips. Not what I was hoping for this late in the month, but when you&#8217;re a Writer Mama, not much you can do! Heading into a weekend of major writing, my kind of weekend!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll fully catch up, but I&#8217;m going to keep going. I&#8217;m 4,339 words behind par and I only have an half an hour of time I can spend writing today. Puts me short for the day, but it&#8217;s late and it&#8217;s a cool number, so fuck it. Just wanted to say a big thanks to all who started following me this week. That seems too quick for the falling in love I&#8217;m aiming for.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m past 45K but not finished with the story. Less than 500 words written and I&#8217;m going to bed at 9pm. But I will get to it&#8230;eventually. 16,720 total words, and I am feeling pretty marvelous.</p>

    <p>If I don&#8217;t do that again I&#8217;ll be fine. I&#8217;ll be doing a writing sprint at 12:30 Pacific Time (in just over ten minutes). While ideas flood through, I&#8217;m oddly at peace. I made it past 25,000 words in my novel today.</p>

    <p>I feel like a total f&#8217;ing failure 3. I&#8217;m full of encouragement today. I haven&#8217;t had a single green day yet! Nothing makes me feel more accomplished than locking in chapters.</p>

    <p>I am definitely in the wrong line of work. After two weeks of just blindly writing whatever came to me, I think I&#8217;ve worked this into a decent storyline. I lost count. I&#8217;m not super happy with the story, will take a lot of editing, but I&#8217;m continuing to write!</p>

    <p>I think I may be more in love with the love interest in my story than my main character is. At this rate, I might finish my new scenes and revisions by&#8230; The character that I spent a lot of time building up just died, and her fiance is about to find out. Wordcount goes up steadily, but I&#8217;m always stuck 7k behind no matter how hard I write! I made it past 25,000 words today.</p>

    <p>Lucas keeps doing it and I&#8217;m not sure where he learned it. Lets get down to business&#8230;.to increase my word count! I&#8217;m looking forward to the second half of the month. I need a few writing prompts, if anyone would be so kind&#8230; But I feel a strong stagnation in my flow.</p>

    <p>Now I&#8217;m only 10k behind! Due to things beyond my control, I started an hour and a half late. I have a few extra scenes and a minor subplot I can do for padding, so hopefully that helps. I&#8217;m so consumed by NaNoWriMo and editing that I think I spend more time following people than tweeting. The sass is so strong with my Micaela.</p>

    <p>Now I can put it away for a while and wait for the big game! I might be behind, but I can see 10K in my future this morning. It&#8217;s either I love my story or I hate it. I hope it gives them to you as well, when you see it. Not hit my personal quota for the day yet, but I&#8217;ve hit the website&#8217;s calculations for catching up. Haven&#8217;t written anything yet today but my head is full of story!</p>

    <p>Nearly half way, but my novel still makes no sense. OMG just 800 more words until I finally reach 25,000 words!! I was listening to the playlist I made for &#8220;John&#8221; and started crying in the car. Hoping I can keep it up for the last half of the month. Another 800 and I&#8217;ll by at the 15k mark, which seems significant.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m not really sure why. I named my Victorian Era brothel &#8220;The Dirty Cleaver&#8221; much to my boyfriend&#8217;s horror. Even if I don&#8217;t finish by November 30, it&#8217;s at least inspired me to start something new. After delaying with a lengthy scene in a karaoke bar, I was finally ready! I really enjoy this side character and wish I could write him more, but I can&#8217;t&#8217; cause, you know, he DIES.</p>

    <p>I might be super behind but progress is progress! I love the word &quot;suddenly. Last 1K I wrote, however, is deeply weird. I have more, but pacing is important.</p>

    <p>&#8220; I&#8217;ve only read 4 books this month, &#8221;cries the girl who usually reads a book a day. Mostly&#8217; focused&#8217; free writing, for me. Sometimes there&#8217;s just other things to do before getting my word count in. I&#8217;ve got airships, motorbikes, gliders, alien (?) Even if I don&#8217;t finish by November 30, it&#8217;s at least inspired me to start something new. &#8220; Justice for Katie &#8221;is going well, word count is at 32K and I&#8217;m more excited the more I write.</p>

    <p>Hit a narrative wall where I&#8217;m not entirely sure the rest of the story is going. I knew I was missing something. I think tomorrow I&#8217;ll start off by reading The Slow Regard Of Silent Things. Taken me 2 weeks and 20K words, incl. Back on track now :) and getting more into my comfort zone. I&#8217;m excited to be sooo close to the end!</p>

    <p>Now I want to play Half Life 2 again. I think I can reach my goal if I play my cards right. I&#8217;m doing it too and let me tell you IT IS NOT EASY. And that&#8217;s another 1,395 words down, if I counted correctly, fora total of 2,407 words written today. I wrote almost five thousand words today, so yes, I am fucking fabulous, thank you for noticing.</p>

    <p>Half way home and my pager still blowing up. I&#8217;ll be shooting for 2,825 words tomorrow. More importantly, deadlines drive me. I wrote absolutely nothing today, but I feel like my cold has gone away. I am in Starbucks! After missing a day for the best reason ever I&#8217;m already up to 20,444.</p>

    <p>This week long detox has been great for my body, but my muse is starving! I tried to google this but found nothing useful. Not much more before I&#8217;ll be back on schedule. When everyone goes to a bar to watch The Game, and I&#8217;m left alone to get some words onto my screen&#8230; Not sure what that says about me.</p>

    <p>I just missed adding my total in before midnight, so it thinks I&#8217;m behind, but I&#8217;m not! If I can write 1,500 words before the guys arrive for MTG, I will allow myself to play a few games. Still pretty behind on my word count at 20k, but I think I&#8217;ll pull ahead now. Okay, at this point I think I&#8217;m just putting off writing because I know the end is near. Now I&#8217;m even more excited myself!</p>

    <p>she just tried to matchmake my gay mc with her best male friend who is in love with her. A small victory but only the beginning of my writing journey today! Too lazy to transfer it to my computer tonight.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a couple of days behind and could really use some motivation at the moment! Hate how my chart bars stay right on that line! And I love it.</p>

    <p>And yes, that&#8217;s counting the first year where I made a random events plot. Following her for a better plot than I started with! Today I will try to push past 20,000 words. Haven&#8217;t been able to reward myself with Sailor Moon Crystal&#8217;s newest ep so I shall drink and be merry at the wedding tonight.</p>

    <p>Let&#8217;s see if I remain on track for more than 24h this time. (I&#8217;m not crazy I swear) Today I&#8217;m visiting 8th grade classes talking ab writing rough drafts! I am behind my personal quota. RS : Although next year, I&#8217;m going to prepare a random jar of motivational snippets to keep me going.</p>

    <p>Dragged 2222 words out from the dark recesses of my subconscious and nailed them into word. If I can most of the beats done today, I&#8217;ll have a fairly steady time till the end. I am definitely in the wrong line of work. I write too many sex scenes for this to qualify as a YA novel.</p>

    <p>Tell me more. I&#8217;m so excited for this weekend. Rereading bits of my story for inspiration. Last year was such a fail I don&#8217;t know what happened. Shit I&#8217;m calling it. Like Arya Stark, I say &quot;Not today!</p>

    <p>Thank you, brain, but just cuz I&#8217;m looking for creepy words doesn&#8217;t mean you can then write that we are &quot;stalking up for winter. Hopefully I can work just as quick before the gym this evening. I&#8217;m the definition of an amateur. I&#8217;m going to make it all about a single hug. Word count isn&#8217;t where I&#8217;d hoped but after being gone most of the day, it&#8217;s still not bad at all.</p>

    <p>Be sure to send me an email if u&#8217;d like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K! I feel like a detective in the middle of my own story! There we go, it&#8217;s midnight and I just made word count for the day! And now I&#8217;m officially half way. Let&#8217;s see if I can get Lars the cat into some trouble today. Whole family sick and I&#8217;m running out of bleach wipes.</p>

    <p>Internet, for many reasons you are making me bawl tonight. I&#8217;m confident I can do it, but I think I&#8217;m running on adrenaline right now. I lied. I just wrote 2,000 words in a half an hour. Cue Bon Jovi&#8217;s Livin&#8217; on a Prayer&#8217; cause I&#8217;m half way there! I can feel my eyes getting very sleepy :(</p>

    <p>Be sure to send me an email if u&#8217;d like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K! I&#8217;m considering going through my novel and editing my contractions to make the full two words. In other news : I have written 50,000 words in 13 days. I had to go to the hospital everyday for a week. 1 a.m., secretly writing a novel in the dark, under covers, on my iPhone.</p>

    <p>In lieu of writing, I annotated my Scrivener note cards to figure out the mess I need to revise. The next book I write will have to be set somewhere bright and sunny. I wanted a 5k Saturday, but I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s going t&#8217;happen. No I don&#8217;t live in Twin Peaks. I am now a full 2 days ahead!</p>

    <p>Alright&#8230;2 down&#8230;going to get a few more words into 3 and then maybe I can slow the pace down a little bit. 16th November : HOW ARE THERE STILL 15 DAYS TO GO I CANT TAKE THIS ANY MORE. I&#8217;m not sure. Headache isn&#8217;t as bad, so I&#8217;m hoping for an extra epic writing day. Okay, I&#8217;m done procrastinating.</p>

    <p>36890&#8230;I can hardly stop now, can I? By cheating EVER SO SLIGHTLY and counting the words written after midnight as yesterday&#8217; s, I AM NOW OFFICIALLY ON PAR AGAIN! I&#8217;m putting down what I have stagnated on to start on something else. I am DOING it! I had to move into the livingroom and light the fireplace. I&#8217;ve seen so many people use music to help them write.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a little stuck now. Last 1K I wrote, however, is deeply weird. Lucky to have teenagers I can leave to their own devices.</p>

    <p>I think I can finish it but it&#8217;s going to be hard. I went from being over 5K words behind last week to over a day ahead today. Apparently I&#8217;ve decided that writing a novel in 30 days isn&#8217;t challenging enough for me. I think about 25 of those words are worth reading, but hey! Now I&#8217;m in my favorite place on the planet : bed.</p>

    <p>Opened my eyes an hour later&#8230;I guess I&#8217;ll need to type a little faster&#8230; Not writing a romance, but my main character just had the best first date ever. I am a gray creature who cannot be forced into a single crevice of definition. I&#8217;ve had a pretty good writing day considering all the stuff I&#8217;ve been doing today.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a little over 900 away from 30k!! If I can hit 30,000 words before the end of this weekend, that would make life a little easier. But it&#8217;s pretty cool to see that since this time last week, I&#8217;ve written almost 10,000 words! Getting to know my characters a bit better now.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been getting a little behind. As my antagonist&#8217;s arc gets more and more convoluted and cruel, I want to write his prospective less and less. I&#8217;m officialy in subplot hell realizing I still don&#8217;t have a ending, or a lowest moment I&#8217;m satisfied with.</p>

    <p>I think I have more in me. I feel very positive about the future. This is turning into a book I can&#8217;t put down! Still a little behind but I have til Sat night to hit 25k.</p>

    <p>Ok, I give in to my wrist. I won&#8217;t finish a ms this month, but it is really helping me more disciplined in committing to write! going to be Nano Sprinting at 8pm Eastern&#8230;come join and write with me!!! I seriously need to get back to my writing. I&#8217;m getting ready to get this bad boy started. Still a little behind but I&#8217;ll get there.</p>

    <p>A slow, but steady pace has gotten me to just over 24,000. I&#8217;m happy with what is left in the plot. I have taken a small break after reaching 30k words. Sometimes, I think Aleia will make a great Queen, but she would sacrifice 1 life to save a whole city without thought.</p>

    <p>I even wrote a little unplanned fight scene. Okay, so I&#8217;m just over 25,000 words at the end of day 15. This brings me to a little over halfway to my goal for today. I JUST NEED 951 MORE WORDS.</p>

    <p>&#8230;what if my novel sucks?? I literally lost about 500 words today due to a massive plot change. I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free!</p>

    <p>Guess I&#8217;ll write for a little before I cave to the siren call of my pillow. I guess because I&#8217;m doing the literary equivalent of that, and it&#8217;s inspiring me. These characters love to talk and will not let me stop writing. I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;d be dead by now if looks could kill. Why yes I am listening to the Nutcracker soundtrack as I write. &quot; (I didn&#8217;t write that, but it&#8217;s still totally appropriate.)</p>

    <p>I need to write a billion more words tonight (3,000) and all I can think about is my bed. I have thought of a brilliant way to make life harder for my MCs. 31,061 and my editing process is actually netting more words because I&#8217;m a horrible human being. Now to be lazy for a few hours, cause I deserved it. I should write at least 10k words but I don&#8217;t feel like writing.</p>

    <p>I think I&#8217;ll get my word count in late tonight. Been camping with my laptop and notebooks in Costa for a few hours now. With everything else going on right now, I think I may admit defeat. Okay, I&#8217;m done writing for the day.</p>

    <p>Cocoa had knocked thm in2 trash becuz I ws late serving breakfast. Which gets me past the 10k. I have just less than a thousand words to go before I hit 30K. And I told myself I was going to do this today&#8230; If I make it to 25k by midnight, I am both a full day ahead and officially halfway done! How many words can I write today?</p>

    <p>The writing I&#8217;ve engaged in over recent months, specifically the novel, have been hollow. Determination has now put me at 2,800 words written today, and more tomorrow. I&#8217;m also vaguely disturbed by the fact that I seem to be killing off all my male characters. 36,527 and my hands won&#8217;t stop shaking every few minutes. I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m at a little over 27k. It took longer than usual, but I&#8217;m done for the day. Why do you all have so many words and where&#8217;s my motivation?</p>

    <p>At least I had a bit of a buffer going into this. Headaches have really left me behind on my word count, looks like I&#8217;m pulling another all nighter! I&#8217;ve lost my mojo when my character went down a hill. nano helps to push me. Been a great day so far, managed to reach all my goals up to this point! Anyone make more than me?</p>

    <p>I may have to take a nap and wake up to write more. As much as I would love to watch more Willow I have to stop and write my own queer witches&#8230; So no sleep tonight so I can stay ahead. It&#8217;s dark, rainy, cozy, writey weather and I&#8217;m pounding the hell out of this book. Just blew past my halfway point, and the momentum grows. I&#8217;m still plodding along in fits and starts.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a bit late I gotta catch up. I hope this isn&#8217;t becoming my thing. 549, not too bad, but my friend still beat me by a few lol. I&#8217;ll be fine. I plan on doing nanowrimo once and winning once.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m not sure if this is normal : I&#8217;ve been staring at the same page of this draft for about 4 hours. To any NSA agents who might be monitoring me : My recent disturbing search history is just research for my novel, I swear. I guess we&#8217;ll see if I manage to get any more done.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;d really just like to get to 25,000 for the month, though I&#8217;m happy with my progress. Not really worried about my overall word count. &#8217; Death is always late to a drowning, my dear.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a bit late to the party.. My background is in news so my fear of missing a deadline is pushing me on. will never run out of things to clean, so here I need to stop and say, &quot;this is good enough, now get those words out. Okay, I&#8217;m making you guys a promise.</p>

    <p>With a little luck and some diligence at the keyboard, I should finish the WIP tomorrow night. 18k and I&#8217;m suddenly excited about my plot again. I have one more after this one. I had a late start, due to edits on another book. Got 31,000 words in November, but 52,000 if I include words I did B4 November. &quot; I have to find a way to sort of let him know without saying it in so many words&#8230;</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m moving towards my next plot point as best I can. But now that most of the Krimmer camp is up, not looking like I&#8217;ll go much over 1K. In the last two hours I have written approximately 1,095 words&#8230; I could swear I&#8217;ve typed &#8220;kill me&#8221; at least 25 thousand times.</p>

    <p>Twitter as much as I love you I am putting you away for a while. And no new words in my novel. But, at least I managed to catch up on some housework.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve hit 22k, ready for day 14 and a weekend of planning the next half of the book! I&#8217;m so glad that &#8220;the&#8221; counts as a word. November may the worst month to write a novel and go gluten free, but that&#8217;s okay because I&#8217;m insane. I&#8217;ve been having trouble writing for 3 days now. A lot of my drafting process might be injecting more character into my MC.</p>

    <p>I have words to throw down! Guess I should be happy I don&#8217;t have to choose between two equally shitty lines. Going to write many words this weekend to catch up to my goal. This whole writing every day thing is ruhl bad for my fingers. I&#8217;m sufficiently limbered up. Two days of food poisoning means I haven&#8217;t been able to sit vertically let alone write anything.</p>

    <p>After today I should be ahead enough that I can take the holidays of Dragon Age and Thanksgiving off! I could write more but PALINDROME, PEOPLE. I have a really hard time accepting that rubber band is two words. this chapter is 22 pages so far and it&#8217;s not done omg I&#8217;m so sorry in advance to my readers. I would love to tell your story.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free! I am one full day ahead and HALFWAY DONE! Not sure I have 28k words left in me for this story&#8230; Not sure how I feel about this&#8230; my characters are ridiculously complex.</p>

    <p>At least I&#8217;m trying. I am definitely in the wrong line of work. I just made my main character blind and I don&#8217;t know what to do with that. I stopped at exactly 40k words tonight. A Noveltini and witty banter await me&#8230; Okay, now that I&#8217;ve had some sugary sustenance, it&#8217;s time to write.</p>

    <p>You&#8217;re running round in circles, calling out my name&#8230; I&#8217;m currently at 3k, but I&#8217;m honestly happy with 5k today. &quot; I better get moving. Now I&#8217;m finally past 10k. I&#8217;ve hit a wall. I think i might actually be able to do this.</p>

    <p>I need more sleep. I literally don&#8217;t have time to read a book that I have to in my free time. then i shall look back at my work and think &quot;what the fuck am i writing. I&#8217;ve made it past the 50000 mark!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m in the Week 2 doldrums. I can&#8217;t stop writing, this is fantastic! But hey, at least I&#8217;m writing. Still several thousand words behind, but I made it past 20,000 words today! I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free!</p>

    <p>Going about London I mean? I passed 16k, but I&#8217;m still struggling to write today. I found a better workflow in it and it helps me organize my ideas.</p>

    <p>And Now I must go to bed because the last 1000 all but refused to get onto the page and I&#8217;m exhausted. I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free! I wrote so few words, I didn&#8217;t even add them up and add it to my word count. More writing time when I get home.</p>

    <p>Passed 20.000 words, but I am behind of my personal goal of 25k. I always take a week of November as holiday to make sure I keep on target. Even if nothing else happens, at least I met my quota.. I wrote over 6k today&#8230; It&#8217;s awesome to see a string of completed story drafts in my recent Google docs.</p>

    <p>Okay, can I hit 30k this evening? I&#8217;ll go one more hour. I need a break to plot my next few scenes! The words are flowing, but I&#8217;m not sure this idea can reach 50k words in the end. I stepped away for no more than two minutes and I&#8217;ve lost 800 words what the fudge!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m only about 3K behind now. And my love. I&#8217;m at that part of the novel where it just sucks&#8230;the writing sucks, the plot sucks, and I suck. Did I lose the spark? 1668 words today and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m getting any more tonight.</p>

    <p>The more I write, the more it becomes habit. All of my best work is done with it as editing is half the fun! Gone past 27K and done writing for the day while I let the tablet charge and rest. It&#8217;s tough, there have been days where I&#8217;ve been like, &quot;HELL no, no more.</p>

    <p>Then maybe I can shift focus. I&#8217;ve seen too many people despairing at not hitting word counts. Tonight I must get Guardian up to 25k no matter how late I have to stay up. Not sure if I will use this scene but I am going to finish it because you never know. I have more that I could write, but I&#8217;m saving the words for tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Since I&#8217;m writing by hand, my time to stop is usually when my hand starts to hurt and get tired. I&#8217;ve been handwriting my notes the past few days. I may not be up to speed, but I think I&#8217;m catching up pretty well. I get the most words when I write sex scenes.</p>

    <p>With midnight past, I&#8217;m officially 5K behind again. Not sure what I should call it. This time last year I had 3 villains who&#8217;s motives I understood. I love getting ahead on the weekends. It&#8217;s more challenging for me to reveal through dialogue than to reveal through narration.</p>

    <p>I think I hit THE WALL. I love the name, this makes November much more bearable. Looks like I&#8217;ll be staying up late to get it done tonight. THIS IS THE PART WHERE I GET REALLY ANXIOUS GUYS. I&#8217;m at the point I just don&#8217;t care about this story any more.</p>

    <p>And I just remembered what I was planning for these other ones&#8230; I think I&#8217;ll get my word count in late tonight. I&#8217;m already at 34K and I have a feeling it&#8217;s gonna take 9K more to wrap things up.</p>

    <p>I feel stuck on this chapter! I think it&#8217;s more of a challenge. I mean month. A Noveltini and witty banter await me&#8230;</p>

    <p>I have done the impossible and that makes me mighty. I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free! I got started late. I feel like such a fail. But I won&#8217;t be able to keep up this rate for the rest of the month.</p>

    <p>Oh my god. I feel like the baddies need more page time in my WIP. 6,578 words behind today&#8217;s total quota, but I&#8217;ve almost met the 1,667 word daily quota. I&#8217;ll have to SERIOUSLY catch up this weekend, hope everyone else is writing. Tomorrow maybe I&#8217;ll have 35k total? I love NaNo.</p>

    <p>Keep at it, then ship it :) It&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve had to do. Still going strong in my quest for 5k tonight. I like parts of it, but I don&#8217;t love it. I need to get some serious writing done this weekend.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m getting tired, but still 2k short of where I want to be tonight. I like the character more and more. Slowly realizing that I&#8217;m not even halfway through the plot, though&#8230; That&#8217;s it for tonight I guess. Ok I&#8217;ll just go to sleep on that.</p>

    <p>I love it when a plan comes together. I&#8217;m okay with that. Now I need to stay up late to get my daily word count. I&#8217;m at 22.5k words so I am just a little behind. I feel like a dumb failure today.</p>

    <p>Be sure to send me an email if u&#8217;d like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K! Except I&#8217;m not entirely sure what happens in the second half. I did so badly that time, only 295.</p>

    <p>I just thought if anyone saw my internet search history, I could be in trouble. One more day off the clock, I think, before I start tackling my remaining word count. Day 14 and I&#8217;m over half way! I&#8217;ll do better tomorrow.</p>

    <p>still 1K behind but at least I got some writing done. I&#8217;m closer to being caught up, but still a little under 2,000 words behind schedule. I wrote an entire scene longhand. &#8220; I&#8217;m too lovesick for love stories &#8221; I&#8217;m just going to write and write and write some more.</p>

    <p>They will see themselves as pirates but I&#8217;ve got their mannerisms nailed. Let&#8217;s see if I remain on track for more than 24h this time. The pain in my chest makes it impossible to relax enough to write! Sure mom I&#8217;ll go to bed before 10:00&#8230;</p>

    <p>I need 875 more words to have 5k for the day&#8230; Excuse my while I award myself a medal for being so awesome. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how&#8230; But at least I&#8217;m not 12,000 words behind anymore.</p>

    <p>2,874 words and outlined a quarter of my novella. With the life experience I&#8217;ve had, I would think I could describe being hungover better than this. I&#8217;m running out of words for the dark. I&#8217;m still 6,000 words behind but making small bits of progress! It may take a miracle but I&#8217;m hopeful! One more day should see me there.</p>

    <p>But I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s not actually pig intestines. Okay, I&#8217;m officially awake. Now I&#8217;m only 5,000 words behind! Okay, I am hella close to 28k, but it&#8217;s also hella close to 4am.</p>

    <p>Really enjoying my neighbour&#8217;s drilling. I&#8217;m writing 1,667 words a day (on average) and by the end of November I hope to have 50,000. I seem to get in the zone around 3pm (Writing Zone or Nap Zone, hard to predict!).</p>

    <p>3490 words so far, and I&#8217;m not done yet. Most of the time I find myself thinking &quot;Eh&#8230; Welp, seriously think I&#8217;m gonna have problems getting to 50K with this story alone&#8230; I so don&#8217;t feel safe at work today.</p>

    <p>At least I&#8217;m back on the horse. Gone past 24K, which means I&#8217;m going to go home soon! Be sure to send me an email if u&#8217;d like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K!</p>

    <p>Ah, how I love late night writing. Okay, I&#8217;ve made my minimum word count goal for today. Er, I mean, what slashfic? Once I get started, stopping is almost equally as hard. It&#8217;s come to my attention just how much I love the night.</p>

    <p>It seems that I&#8217;m doing my most productive writing at coffee shops. &quot; Okay look, I don&#8217;t care if you weren&#8217;t listening, but you can&#8217;t just say&#8217; Oh&#8217; as if you&#8217;re baiting me for a reply. This is huge for me. Sick kids and a homicidal chair derailed me, but I am finally getting back on track. Need to start to revise so I can feel in the thick of things again. At least I managed to save it!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m writing my first Stupid Death Loophole : &#8220;Yeah, he got his jaw blown off, but he&#8217;s a werewolf and the bullet wasn&#8217;t silver! Ok, I think I can write my ass of and get this last 2k in before 4 AM YEAH?! &#8221; I learnt a lot about myself in the 10 minutes it took to die &quot;I love this line.</p>

    <p>Left it at a scene I&#8217;ll enjoy writing tomorrow. 5,600 words behind par, and not sure how I will catch up. The most I&#8217;ve ever written for one piece.</p>

    <p>I guess that gives me no better excuse to just stay home and write. I&#8217;m using more tissues than I&#8217;m writing words. I have teens who are just as annoying but not as cute. This is why I&#8217;m NOT a successful novelist. ONLY 800 MORE WORDS UNTIL I MEET MY FIRST GOAL! 512 more words and I can go to sleep.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Let my fingers overcome my creative lapses. I&#8217;m over 17k but feel so far behind. Late but I did it!</dt>

        <dd>(I will get it back by the end of the night! Just realized that 2 stories in a row I&#8217;ve mentioned bird poop on the very first page. I love the feeling I get after reaching and surpassing my goal.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>After the tragic data loss yesterday, I&#8217;m finally back up to par! I think I&#8217;m gonna skip out on writing again today but try really hard to kick ass over the weekend. I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free! I need more words.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, I have NO idea what happens next. Now I can write better. I wrote 3k this morning but now I&#8217;m experiencing some serious focus issues this afternoon. Think I just made some new adventurous, insecure, creative best friends! Would have wrote more, but I was questioned A LOT as a suspect.</p>

    <p>I always seem to fail on the second week. Ok, on that sprint I got 316. Just in case writing a novel sounds as pretentious as I think it does, let me assure you that mine sucks! All my old favorites to get me through 2000 more words. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217; mma push myself any more tonight.</p>

    <p>Let&#8217;s see if I can do better while it&#8217;s brewing. I typed 6591 words to my story today, beating my personal best. I&#8217;m so excited! Think I&#8217;ve just finished one of the most disgusting scenes I&#8217;ve ever written. Hopefully I&#8217;ll hit 1k if not more! Explaining what rooms look like are very hard for me.</p>

    <p>Or at least before I&#8217;m booted from the table! I&#8217;m a little behind but know I can catch up. I love the voice of your site. I think Ive been reading too many angsty romance novels..</p>

    <p>Not bad considering I had to go in to work. I love symmetrical word counts. I&#8217;m like 10k behind, so I&#8217;ve got some serious making up to do. One more session will see me break through the 50,000 barrier.</p>

    <p>I hate myself right now. Feedback you don&#8217;t want from your reading group : &quot;I love that you went with spiral binding this time. At least I wrote a few hundred words at the auto shop! Today, I discovered the magical power my character has.</p>

    <p>Not that all distractions are bad, or that I haven&#8217;t enjoyed the distractions of the past two evenings. Today I am only a measly 1122 words behind. Less than 500 words to go until I break 25k! Saved me so many times this novel. Like, I wanna know more about it, but I never get to see it. Ok twitter, I&#8217;m here for sprints.</p>

    <p>In case I haven&#8217;t said it already, writing is hard. From here on out, this is the most words I&#8217;ve written for one thing. Might, might write some crap later, but my offspring will make that hard. This being true, I&#8217;ve raised procrastination to an art form. Doing better than I thought I was, I guess.</p>

    <p>I am excited to get to the&#8217; reveal&#8217; at the end of this story. I novel better when I&#8217;m in musicals. Still a few thousand behind but I&#8217;ll get there! I at least have a plan. I wish my characters would talk more.</p>

    <p>Not writing for now bc researching a nutso plot bunny that came at me hard. Kendrick Lamar makes me want to be a better writer and tell better stories. Been letting my efforts slip lately. &quot; I better get moving.</p>

    <p>I plan to ponder this plot some more while I deal with this commute. I love it. So looking back at my life choices, november was the worst possible time to get completely obsessed with Teen Wolf. I&#8217;m behind in word count but just passed 15000 words.</p>

    <p>I am determined to escape this&#8217; always 10k behind&#8217; thing I have going on. I am a mean, mean, mean writer person. Oh hello extra 200 words that I didn&#8217;t think I had in me tonight, so nice to see you there! I&#8217;m glad you powered through. I love truly wicked characters.</p>

    <p>okay, you got me. How many watchlists am I on now? Not goin 2 b negative, I can do it. I&#8217;ll need to up my game today.</p>

    <p>Can I just say that I love this season? I&#8217;ll do better tomorrow. What I love most about writing, is that you somehow end up googling ginger cats named Napoleon and it all makes sense. I&#8217;m not pleased. Still behind but at least I reached the 20,000 mark. Setting aside my football brain for a moment so I can get in some words before the FSU game.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m beat, but I&#8217;m glad I made it through. I think I&#8217;m in love with it. I keep telling myself to shower, or eat, or at least brush my teeth&#8230; I&#8217;m procrastinating because I&#8217;m 12,000 words behind&#8230;</p>

    <p>The antagonist is so evil he&#8217;s starting to scare me, is that normal??? My favorite line written before midnight : &quot;I love you. I bet I can get at least another 600! I have an overwhelming desire to reread Falling Kingdoms right now. How many words can I write before the water boils?</p>

    <p>Oh god I&#8217;m behind on wordcount and I&#8217;m sitting here writing crappy poetry. I am officially less than one day behind on my word count! Someone light a fire under my butt&#8230; 1500 more words to write to hit my goal of the day. I didn&#8217;t do any writing at all yesterday and I&#8217;m bummed about it way more than I should be.</p>

    <p>I LOST A WEEK&#8217;S WORTH OF WORDS?!? Trying desperately to stay ahead, since I foresee dark days during Thanksgiving hullabaloo. I love it when a plan comes together.</p>

    <p>&quot; The words I was thinking of weren&#8217;t nearly so kind. Five more minutes of writing before I run off. I mean, take months to write novels! People have been attempting to convince me to get an apple laptop instead of my huge iMac. Now to write 3 more and I&#8217;ll be done with my goal for this month.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m late. I love being in denial the author way. Maybe I&#8217;ll be able to write today if I just whack my head against the wall repeatedly. Which (for me) is next to impossible. I love basketball. Not writing this story that has been in my mind for almost 10 years or more.</p>

    <p>The last scene I wrote was really depressing so I took a longer break and watched Liv and Maddie on Disney, don&#8217;t judge me. Also my story has become about magic drug dealers. Still behind if I&#8217;m going to hit 50k this month. That now leaves me really far behind on WC. November is my favorite month of the year.</p>

    <p>I never knew what crazy whim I&#8217;d have to adapt to next. I wonder how many people have written a script instead of a novel. Tomorrow is the day that I will be writing and writing and writing and more writing. So, I started late (11 days late!) The cute server at my fave writing pub has just arrived. I love everything about writing&#8230;</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m tempted to give up and start a new story, but I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll do the same once I&#8217;ve started that. Okay, I&#8217;m out for the night. Write some more crap, check my word count. After a break with the family, I have broken 15,000 words. 14,635 total words, and I think it is safe to say that this writing night has been beyond successful. Alright, I&#8217;ve got some more writing to do now.</p>

    <p>I came in late so managed 665. Ok, I am stuck and I have no motivation to write&#8230; Why do I need so many wards in my kingdom? I was sick yesterday so it&#8217;s double word count Thursday for me today. I would love to tell your story. So many plot inconsistences but I can&#8217;t change them till December.</p>

    <p>About 4k behind on my nanos. I&#8217;m like 10k behind, so I&#8217;ve got some serious making up to do. Officially half a day ahead on my word count. I just wrote my favorite scene in my novel yet. I&#8217;m more than halfway through the novel now&#8230;</p>

    <p>32,575 and I&#8217;m satisfied with how things are turning out. My MC just opened up about trauma he experienced and now I&#8217;m ready to bawl. A little over halfway through the month, a little over halfway through my word count. :(I will get it back by the end of the night! Poor word count day for me today, 763.</p>

    <p>also love that the characteristics I had planned for both of these kids basically swapped somehow&#8230; I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free! I just wrote like 639 in less than 20 minutes!!! I&#8217;m tired.</p>

    <p>Feels like I left my muse out in the cold. Suffering from an interesting form of writer&#8217;s block where my computer (where my story is) is literally blocked by Chriss. And to show you I mean business : I&#8217;m taking a nap. Had my best writing day of the month yet, with 7.6k written, bringing my total up to 64,283 words!</p>

    <p>If I don&#8217;t do that again I&#8217;ll be fine. My book was better before I wrote it&#8230; I fell behind yesterday but hey. Surely I could quite.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m still woefully behind, but I now have A Plan. But at least it&#8217;s keeping me writing! MC on a great adventure right now and all I can think is how much I want to travel his route. I want to write about a girl who&#8217;s recruited as a Reaper, after Death saves her life, but falls in love with a ghost. If I can just get over this 25,000 hump I am almost positive I can win.</p>

    <p>just 200 more words to write to meet my goal. I hurt top to bottom. Enjoying what I&#8217;m doing with my NaNo. I know I&#8217;m doing something wrong with this WIP but I CAN&#8217;T TELL and it&#8217;s driving me nuts. I&#8217;m 9100 behind with mine. I&#8217;m falling behind.</p>

    <p>So I need to write like 4000 words today to catch up with the average! I&#8217;m ok with that. I&#8217;m so behind and tired. It&#8217;s like CHRISTMAS, I can hardly sleep! I have no regrets over a wonderful evening with friends, or getting the leaves raked.</p>

    <p>I hit 56k today and going strong toward the finish. Apparently there are times when I write best if I&#8217;m listening to One Direction&#8230; Thank you word sprints, my random writing (all over the place but still in plot) brings me to 20,353 words so far! If I make the word goal for today I get to play a video game. I sure home the night of writing dangerously isn&#8217;t cold! Although I had no motivation earlier, once I started writing I got into a real nice groove and wrote some good stuff.</p>

    <p>11:28 pm and I&#8217;m absolutely exhausted&#8230; I&#8217;ve had 2 : Day 2 got me behind. Made it to 25k yesterday, and I&#8217;m still feeling pretty good about this story. OK, writing marathon here I come. I think that is more than deserving of a wine.</p>

    <p>Despite my best intensions, this busy weekend has thrown me off. I&#8217;m glad my brain is on salary, I couldn&#8217;t afford to pay it hourly. I&#8217;m dangerously close to facing my writing enemy : rushing the plot too fast. Hopefully I can step up my game tonight. Me : I&#8217;m 13,549 words behind schedule.</p>

    <p>I kind of love writing this amoral dragon character. I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free! Attempting to TRIPLE DOWN on my word count today! Not a great writing day and I don&#8217;t know if my story has the steam to make it to 50,000 words. I hate everything about my Nano currently.</p>

    <p>trying to reach 20K tonight, not sure if I will make it! Maybe I can beat my personal best and get 6k written today. I think that is more than deserving of a wine. I&#8217;ve been hard on myself for falling behind, but I wrote over 25,000 words in two weeks, and that deserves a FUCK YEAH GO ME! I just said &quot;3 more people must die for me to finish my novel. Guess I&#8217;d better get a couple hundred words in before bed.</p>

    <p>Not so sure, but I&#8217;m loving the story that&#8217;s unfolding. A better day for writing yesterday although I did take the evening off to spend with my daughter. I tried REALLY HARD to stop them! Words : 23108 it would appear that I am behind again&#8230;</p>

    <p>I won&#8217;t be able to write all day so I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve got that buffer! I found me a better pen&#8230; I haven&#8217;t been as stylistically obsessed as usual, but that will come in editing. Ugh, fell behind because I didn&#8217;t write for two days.</p>

    <p>That might seem behind, but I&#8217;m bursty. I&#8217;m behind. I&#8217;d like to be at least at 30k before I leave tomorrow. How many can I manage today? I should be able to hit 25k by Sunday without a problem. I&#8217;m super fucking great at procrastination.</p>

    <p>Awesome, now to finish my story and maybe start a new one. I wonder how many hours I would have to put in to finish my novel today? I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s wrong with me. I&#8217;m so behind.</p>

    <p>I told my best friend about the plot today and she got so insanely excited which made me excited. Better walk in with an outline so I make the most of my time. My 4th but my three no successful. I think I&#8217;m broken.</p>

    <p>Hoping to seriously catch up on my word count today. you guys, I&#8217;ll be winning tomorrow, js. I have many more words to go today! I AM SO BEHIND. Thank goodness I have an adorable love interest blooming to offset the rest of the doom. One scene is now locked into the draft, and I&#8217;m pretty happy with it.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m feeling pretty good about moving forward now. It&#8217;s a,&#8217; I&#8217;m just going to swallow my gum,&#8217; kind of day. I&#8217;m exhausted. I AM SO TIRED but m 1,333 words need to be written. I&#8217;ve still got some catching up to do&#8230;</p>

    <p>Having not really experienced any of those things, I&#8217;m hardly qualified to write about them. I&#8217;m still writing strong! 25080 words.Half way to done with this terrible but oddly compelling (to me) fiction. Now I need a suitable distraction.</p>

    <p>I gotta say, that feels pretty damn good. I will not cry at my own fic&#8230; Did I miss a few days? One of the m.c.&#8217;s in my horror novel : &quot;If there&#8217;s anything worse than being truly alone, it&#8217;s never truly being alone. Okay, I took a couple days off, but I shall get to 30K before I sleep tonight. I&#8217;m kind of at that point of the month where I&#8217;m wondering why I&#8217;m doing this.</p>

    <p>Only 10K words so I&#8217;m behind schedule. Tomorrow I&#8217;m having a writing retreat for myself, because my own house distracts me sometimes. (Still 15K behind where I should be&#8230;) I need an answer to &quot;How was your golf game? I will not cry at my own fic.</p>

    <p>I have a better routine during the work week. okay, you got me. Let&#8217;s see if I can get some of the 3k words I&#8217;m behind on done as well. Nice to let my brain reboot.</p>

    <p>Omg. I realized I am every further behind than I thought. I&#8217;ll be honest. Ack, using Word instead of my usual Scrivener. Killed a character off, my poor MC. Alright, laptop, stop having a bitch fit for like 5 mins and let me get some work done! Gotta run on my own.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m well behind at the moment. I spoke to the muses and told them to be sure to keep you company. &quot; Maybe I told them to fuck their mothers. I love this time of year. The problem with stopping my wordcount on a sexy palindrome is that I don&#8217;t want to write more!</p>

    <p>I once went through a phase of excessively using &#8220;indeed&#8221; in my writing. A Noveltini and witty banter await me&#8230; Shows how tired I am&#8230; Kicking my own ass like never b4.</p>

    <p>Today is a &#8220;Listen to Disturbed while I write about demons and Thrift Store Mechs&#8221; kind of day. after I go write 2k more. 200 words in and I&#8217;m not sure my characters are going to like this chapter. I&#8217;m tired. I&#8217;m 2,000 words behind.</p>

    <p>okay folks, I&#8217;m doing a 1k30min. &#8220; &#8221;I don&#8217;t give a flying fuck what it&#8217;s called if it doesn&#8217;t exist,&quot; Autumn retorted. I just wish the Universe would send some kind of sign&#8230;</p>

    <p>Be sure to send me an email if u&#8217;d like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K! I&#8217;m on kind of a roll, but my mama is taking me to see Theory of Everything, so&#8230; Slightly behind schedule, I&#8217;ve broken the 25K mark. I&#8217;m tired. I&#8217;m going to keep writing at my own pace and feel the story as it progresses.</p>

    <p>I am now 4000 words behind. Makes me feel like I&#8217;m part of a secret club. I would love to tell your story. Now I can write better. I have cheerfully passed 30K, I am deliriously happy, it&#8217;s 4 in the morning and I&#8217;m GOING TO SLEEP.</p>

    <p>At least I was caught up for about 24 hours. I&#8217;m toying with the idea of killing a character but they&#8217;re kind of integral to the plot? I&#8217;m tired and want to go to bed. I am litte tired. Having my writing slump break this morning was amazing.</p>

    <p>I will write 4K more before bed. Didn&#8217;t make a full 1667 today, but with a 12 hr work day and a headcold, I feel good about 1400 or so. Way behind, but I don&#8217;t even care. I&#8217;m going to have an amazing word count today.</p>

    <p>At least I&#8217;m still putting out words. &quot; He knelt at a rose bush and did something deep and meaningful that makes me seem like an awesome writer. Jeez, and I&#8217;m still 5,000 words behind. Not as good of a writing day as I would like, but 20,835 words to date is still pretty darn good!</p>

    <p>I will feel so freaking amazing once this mountain of homework is done. I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free! I&#8217;d like to put this weekend behind me now. Holy crap I&#8217;m actually writing a novel!</p>

    <p>Secret fact : I write chapter titles before writing the chapter to keep me accountable to my outline. I haz broken the 25k word count. I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free! I think that is more than deserving of a wine. Writer friend reminds me writing and brain work takes more calories than we realize.Nuts, cheese and protein shakes!</p>

    <p>Better finish the bag before I try again! I am freaking out honestly. Could I have added 11 more to make it 23K? I won&#8217;t win, but I&#8217;m doing it. Which means I&#8217;m behind. I am ALMOST half way there!!!!</p>

    <p>Still a little shy of where I need to be in order to be on par for 150k for the month, but I&#8217;m now almost there! Turns out my characters didn&#8217;t walk into a trap, but they are walking on thin ice. I need to write more. I better get writing 14,00 words done, just 36,00 more to go! JK :) I will beat this novel into submission (pun intended)!</p>

    <p>And I&#8217;m more than halfway in editing Issue 2 of Incendiary. A warm shower is my just reward. You can tell I&#8217;m getting tired when all I write about is night time, sleep, and dreaming. I accidentally wrote a thousand words more so I&#8217;m at 23k now!</p>

    <p>Just kidding, I&#8217;m giddy as fuck. Need to put beer in my tea mug more often. Safe to say that I&#8217;m getting SSB tomorrow! (I am way behind and trying to catch up.) And more to write before I sleep. That kind of blows my mind.</p>

    <p>I love writing! I&#8217;m totally loving this Google Docs thing for people critiqueing my book. I need more time and energy. And I&#8217;m behind again. I may be tired. I believe it was Bruceman Springsteen who said, &quot;I&#8217;m sick of sitting&#8217; round here trying to write this book.</p>

    <p>ending my night of noveling at only 1000 words behind, and no longer am I terribly worried. I mean 50k. 700ish more to go, but I took my migraine meds, so maybe!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;d need to make sure to be home before dinner, tho! And I must say, your app came in quite handy for my research. I mean month. Holy crap, just realized a thing I wrote is totally a metaphor for the character&#8217;s growth during the scene. man I can be twisted.</p>

    <p>I still consider 20k in 11 days to be pretty awesome though. I dream of catching up this weekend. Dammit, I&#8217;m being mean to my MC again. My word count is closing in on 67,000 but I&#8217;m still about 3k behind where I wanted to be. It is cold outside, temps in the 20s, I hate it when it&#8217;s this cold.</p>

    <p>I Love Bar Graphs! Loving my newest character. Okay well I am at 36k. Holy fuck I reached par how did I do that? i&#8217;m done with my novel&#8230;.i&#8217;m about 4000 words shy of 50,000.</p>

    <p>my lovely lady WHAT!? Be honest with me&#8230; Working at Dad&#8217; s. But keep thinking about these girls and whether they&#8217;ll kiss (or more) when I get home. I&#8217;m still a couple of thousand words behind schedule. I am litte tired. I&#8217;m still behind, but I&#8217;m gaining!</p>

    <p>Going to watch Weeds as a reminder how my life could be so much worse. I have more than 25k now! Oh no, my coffee pot is broken. Need more jelly babies to sustain me to the end!</p>

    <p>Learning more about my characters and where the story is going. Okay, let&#8217;s see how close I can get to 2,500 words! Alright, time to patch things up between my MCs and get in some serious wordage! I&#8217;m behind. Hope the rest of you are doing better than me!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m exhausted! Fuck, I&#8217;m out of words to write&#8230; As soon as I procrastinate some more. Got my jet fuel (name of the coffee), my blanket, and amazing direction for HOH2. I need more words!</p>

    <h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6</h2>

    <p>Got a lot of catching up to do on my word count. Doing so good at procrastinating today, I&#8217;ve decided to take the day off. I am wayyyyyyyyyy behind on nano, but today is for planning. My favorite line of my novel : &quot;You look like a giraffe climbing a tree. Anyone have a good prompt for me?</p>

    <p>I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free! And I still have tonight to add more! My brain is fried and I am so behind and I will catch up. I just came up with an amazing idea for another novel. Good day for staying warm, listening to music and working on my story.</p>

    <p>That sounds like a good day to me. I&#8217;m in love with my story! Though I suppose that&#8217;s kind of the point at the moment&#8230; It&#8217;s like CHRISTMAS, I can hardly sleep! I&#8217;m so tired, though.</p>

    <p>Be sure to send me an email if u&#8217;d like me to promote ur book for free to over 17K! Reached 1,314 on my first 30min sprint :D Time for some word wars! And now I&#8217;m 6k behind&#8230; Having a great time in Brooklyn with beautiful people but I really just want to write. What a great supportive family I have.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a fair trade. This full time writing thing is making me very good at putting in eye drops. Using my nephew&#8217;s poem in my book (love it!) I need 259 more today. I think I&#8217;m broken. So I don&#8217;t even feel a little bad about all the reading.</p>

    <p>but I&#8217;m sure gonna try. I would have typed more but my fingers are frozen! I am two units behind in physics. I&#8217;ve written more than you across the years! ohhhh my book is good to me.</p>

    <p>Best writing advice I&#8217;ve ever received : &quot;The only person who can stop you from writing is you. Good, I hope. This novel is a LABOR of love and boy am I laboring tonight. I&#8217;m at 28k, so I had a good 3k day.</p>

    <p>I will not cry at my own fic. I need 500 more words before midnight, in 28 mins! Too bad I have to drive, or I would be getting slightly (unabashedly) drunk. I just sneezed and laughed like it was the funniest thing.</p>

    <p>Today my story seemed to take it&#8217;s own course, I was just along for the ride. I&#8217;m kinda tired. After Thursday&#8217;s flatline, it&#8217;s good to know I didn&#8217;t lose the mojo.</p>

    <p>Wtf is happening, I can&#8217;t stop her. HOW AM I 2,000 WORDS BEHIND? Then I&#8217;ll write more! Good day for staying warm, listening to music and working on my story. I think it&#8217;s been a good day.</p>

    <p>I knit it myself but it&#8217;s Ryan so it won&#8217;t even be warm. I think this sounds like a good plan. Is it bad that I changed the Game Warden in my novel to a woman because hewasn&#8217;t very interesting as a man? 22,000 words and I&#8217;m behind. Has nothing to do with my project, it&#8217;s just good music.</p>

    <p>I also need some sort of serious plot planning or something.. I&#8217;ve been good today but I&#8217;ve still got some catching up to do. I don&#8217;t want to get behind! I can NOT write any more without editing and organizing! I bid u all a good journey, but question everything otherwise ur doomed to fallacies set in stone,despite good intentions or not.</p>

    <p>Hopelessly behind, but at least I&#8217;m going. I guess determining which characters are doomed has been good for my writer&#8217;s block. I mean it! This sounds so good, I almost don&#8217;t want to write anymore.</p>

    <p>I need a good mob family name. Need more jelly babies to sustain me to the end! WHY did I write all of these broken bones into my story? I&#8217;ve got weird priorities.</p>

    <p>That&#8217;s two days in hand, which is good as I&#8217;m going to need them. Good day for staying warm, listening to music and working on my story. I love when my own story surprises me. I&#8217;m still woefully behind, but I now have A Plan. I&#8217;m stuck in the wrong rhyme.</p>

    <p>I think she&#8217;s endured enough crap for now. I guess not being able to sleep is a good thing, means I can catch up! WHY DO I WRITE DIFFICULT HEROINES? Despite my PC having a virus, I managed more than 3,000 words today! I didn&#8217;t say any of them were good&#8230;</p>

    <p>I stopped 95 words shy of 24k tonight. But now I&#8217;m 5k wds behind. Then I&#8217;ll write more! I don&#8217;t ogle good looking guys, I surreptitiously glance and then put them in my novel.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m getting weird looks and lots of questions. The big bad villain of my book is about to make his appearance and announce himself to my hero! Then 4 more days of 2.5k will put me at the 50k mark! (I hope) Let&#8217;s make it a good one. I&#8217;m writing and it feels so good.</p>

    <p>Woke up with &#8220;Go the Distance&#8221; from Hercules stuck in my head&#8230;today will be a good word count day. Glad I got on board just before the Go time! &quot; I&#8217;ve officially fallen behind. 34,603 and I wonder why it&#8217;s so difficult to write a scene comprised of girltalk.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m 6k behind. Now I just have to do that 24 more times, and I&#8217;ll be caught up! The good news is I have a sore throat, killer toothache, and no idea what to write. I fail at novel writing. :) I&#8217;m procrastinating again! Took a good part of the day outline the rest of my novel.</p>

    <p>Happy I Love to Write day! Did I get some good stuff done? Let&#8217;s see if I can get that many tonight! I&#8217;m behind for the 1st time and it&#8217;s stressing me out.) Also, I think I&#8217;m writing the wrong novel. It&#8217;s my one night to get drunk.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m catching up, I&#8217;ve written over 3000 words today! I have some catching up to do, but I had another good day. Broke down the wall standing between me and getting Hattie out of that stupid tree. Picturing Peter Capaldi as the Wizard is dangerous because I keep wanting to close every line of his dialogue with &quot;Fuck off.</p>

    <p>WOW I am so happy and I still want to keep writing! I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m gonna be able to write 10k but 5k would be an awesome goal for me. Also, please tell me I&#8217;m not alone when I&#8217;m literally writing scenes at random. Considering I thought I would fall behind, I just hit the halfway point! I&#8217;m catching up though!</p>

    <p>Best Friday night word count so far but my pillow is calling now. I&#8217;d say today was a successful day of writing. I&#8217;m torn between wanting to write and wanting to watch It&#8217;s Complicated. Started today 5000 words behind and now I&#8217;m caught up! I found a really good chill out playlist on Spotify that&#8217;s great for writing.</p>

    <p>I regret making cake sad. Hearing my wife&#8217;s stories, and borrowing a name from her day to turn into an illegal chemical supplier. Good thing I love it. Doing good, I think. Let&#8217;s be honest, I was going anyway!</p>

    <p>Still behind, but I broke 15K. I also think questioning &#8220;How good your character is under stress&#8221; help reveal alot about them. You know I won&#8217;t be no perfect Stephen King Clone&#8230;so if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re into that go&#8217; head and read another tome&#8230; I napped before, so I fine on sleep! Not doing so good today with my story today.</p>

    <p>Casually getting a ton of muse for something that isn&#8217;t my nano novel. I&#8217;ve been really uninspired today. I think I need to buy more pens! Good thing I&#8217;ve managed to keep up&#8230; I&#8217;d better go write to make up for this atrocity!!</p>

    <p>I ordered a nano hoodie and feel guilty because nano isn&#8217;t over. I can&#8217;t tell if this is a good thing or not. This is actually amazing for me! And I&#8217;ve just broken halfway! All I am saying is the more the merrier, people and words alike! I OWN it!</p>

    <p>Let&#8217;s see how many I can get done!! Then I laughed it off. I got bored. I hit 23k but accidentally stumbled into a awkward, accidental flirting scene which I&#8217;m always terrified to write so&#8230;</p>

    <p>I feel like I should win a prize. If what I&#8217;m writing is any good won&#8217;t be known until editing. I&#8217;d love to promote your book for free! It never ceases to amaze me when my books take random turns all by themselves. Been trudging my way through this and haven&#8217;t even gotten to the truly awkward scene yet.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m so sorry. LOVING my story! I&#8217;m 3000 words behind and at a rut! So I just do my own!</p>

    <p>Just realized my novel is bleak, speculative middle grade. Because I hate you the least. I&#8217;d better go write to make up for this atrocity!!</p>

    <p>&#8217; I&#8217;m on fucking fire today. Yeah I was wrong my goal is 45k. I slacked a couple days but I&#8217;m still ahead, so all is good. I think it&#8217;s great to write romance in it&#8217;s purest way.</p>

    <p>I got some more time to write and hit word 20,052. If anybody&#8217;s sprinting this evening, I&#8217;d be happy for the motivation. So I&#8217;m almost caught up on what little outlining I got done before November started and it&#8217;s terrifying. &quot; I was wrong about you. Beer is making me cooperate tonight, lol.</p>

    <p>Let&#8217;s see if I remain on track for more than 24h this time. I had my mandatory coffee and might get another, lol. Thinking tomato soup for my unhappy throat. My characters have never steered me wrong if I just get out of their way. This makes me happy xD.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m declaring victory for having slogged through that awkward scene, and calling it a night. I set my alarm for 5:30 and randomly woke up at four. Good thing I have all this coffee. I&#8217;ll definitely win, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll hit 80K before the Codex deadline.</p>

    <p>Works better with longer sentences and is way faster than my fingers! Was really happy about my story unfolding yesterday. Didn&#8217;t get a lot of writing done this weekend, but I am still 5000 words ahead and planning on writing like crazy tomorrow. So I can stop feeling guilty for not participating. My earliest&#8217; win&#8217; ever, but I&#8217;m gonna carry on writing until the month ends.</p>

    <p>1am is a really awkward time to get inspiration, but I&#8217;m taking it where I can get it. But now I am very very tired. Need more jelly babies to sustain me to the end! I feel a nice glass of celebratory wine is in order! I am probably inordinately proud of my book, I am not stopping at 50,000 I&#8217;m just going to keep going.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve used it, but I&#8217;d be so afraid to lose my work. I am writing a novel in 30 days, It&#8217;s crazy but attainable. Need more jelly babies to sustain me to the end! OK, HERE I GO!! Saturday is my best shot at catching up.</p>

    <p>And then my muse decided I was wrong. Will I ever reveal whether or not labeling my novel as&#8217; Erotic&#8217; is just for irony? (You&#8217;re welcome, everyone else I&#8217;ll see today.) I should be writing but I&#8217;m so cold I can&#8217;t move. I&#8217;m jealous even though I&#8217;m happy in love. err, writing buddies, and I wanna win.</p>

    <p>30K and insanely stoked, I think I caught my second wind of ideas! Thinking tomato soup for my unhappy throat. Some great scenes today, even if I dare say so myself.</p>

    <p>I can collapse happy after a 1,900 word session. Also I&#8217;m massively behind on it. Im behind in my word count and I think I might hate everything I&#8217;ve written.</p>

    <p>Happy to do my part. but I hate to get behind.</p>

    <p>I am 5,000 words behind. I&#8217;m making great progress but must balance it with revisions. Can&#8217;t sleep bc I have a cold. This cold is messing with my head. I can&#8217;t tell you how happy that makes me.</p>

    <p>&quot; I melted a little bit, like cold butter on toast. I&#8217;ll do a happy dance when I reach it. I will now start writing like crazy to try and get 6K so I&#8217;m at 110K before tomorrow. I&#8217;m declaring victory for having slogged through that awkward scene, and calling it a night. Lol, I said I was going to be taking a break today, but I ended up writing 3246 words.</p>

    <p>Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll win this year&#8230; It&#8217;s been a great way to keep my focus up. Possibly the worst ending sentence I&#8217;ve written in my life, but : draft dance! If there was a National Email Writing Month, I&#8217;d be fucking OWNING it&#8230; If I don&#8217;t make it to 30K tomorrow, I&#8217;m going to be very angry with myself.</p>

    <p>And that&#8217;s not even counting the 3516 words of random fanfic I&#8217;ve written today! I&#8217;m cold, so I crawled under the covers to write. Tonight my raptor stuffed wads of tissues up his nose&#8230;but it was for a really good reason, you guys. I am proud that on day 15(halfway), I&#8217;m halfway through the word count. She took out her good boobs and let me tell you something : they were real good.</p>

    <p>This book has a lot of awkward moments with characters&#8217; mothers, I just realized. Hey girl, the perfect end to any day is one where you read me excerpts of your latest writing project. I find this fascinating and awesome. I write so haphazardly that sometimes I lose the sequence of my novel. This is not going to be good for my word count. Just when I thought I had hit a wall I got a great idea for a subplot that&#8217;s helping.</p>

    <p>My word count makes me sad. I am heartbroken and happy. I wanted 1k so badly, but just didn&#8217;t have it in me that sprint. I need a good night of rest so I can write some tomorrow before the boy I watch arrives!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been in a bad mood ever since. I am going to hit 30k words before the weekend is out because I am a fucking boss. Also,I am proud that I haven&#8217;t used &quot;I let out a breath I didn&#8217;t know I was holding. Good thing I have the day off!</p>

    <p>Note to myself in my manuscript : &#8220;insert bad word here. Reply with any random idea and I will try to incorporate it! Bringing my laptop to a restaurant is my type of &#8221;night of writing dangerously. I was thinking of having something happen to my MC to ruin her good mood, but&#8230; If I get to 25k, I&#8217;ll be happy. It&#8217;s a good word, and it serves my story well!</p>

    <p>I hope you got good writing done anyway! Wish I could have hit 2k words, but am happy with the fact that I wrote. If I feel like what I&#8217;m writing is ridiculous and stupid, I remind myself that they put a dance off in Guardians of the Galaxy. I&#8217;ve got it bad. Too bad, I was on a roll.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m feeling good! I was doing great on my 2K per day goal, and now I&#8217;ve got nothing&#8230; I even gave them guilty thoughts about how wrong it was. I wish I hadn&#8217;t sucked so bad yesterday, though. I&#8217;m so bad at multitasking.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve got one of my characters making jokes during a very tense scene. I think this book will be a good bit longer than 50,000, but I am doing great! I&#8217;ve never had writers block this badly before. It&#8217;s upbeat, beautiful and perfect for my mood.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m totally brilliant until I start writing. It&#8217;s so cold at my computer that I&#8217;m about to start typing with gloves on. I am honestly shocked I&#8217;m still on track&#8230;</p>

    <p>Even if it&#8217;s not my best work, I&#8217;m building a good habit! My wrists are sore, but I am happy. &#8220; &#8221;I&#8217;m a failure, my ideas suck, I hate my life!! Knew this month would be crazy and I&#8217;d probably fail but this is pathetic.</p>

    <p>Sure taught me a lesson! I guess not too bad to start with. &quot; This is us at our best and I wish it could always be like this.</p>

    <p>I have a crazy idea. 5,000 more word to go until I hit my word count goal!!! We&#8217;ve surpassed the halfway mark and I&#8217;m shocked that I still have something to say. So I have this really bad habit of not, reaching word counts. I have this awesome story, but it&#8217;s covered up by a mudslide of crappy words.</p>

    <p>1745 words tonight&#8230;I could keep going, but I fear I am working on fighting being sick and my bed calls. Too bad I have to work two jobs tomorrow so I may not get to write. What is wrong with me?! I am a happy girl, except I need 3K words today. It would be incredible if I could do it. It is a challenge, but I am pushing along with the support of my wonderful wife.</p>

    <p>And that&#8217;s my lead :( I understood the screams of my victims, and the cries of their loved ones when the bodies were found. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m perfect par for day 10!!!&#8230;</p>

    <p>Nano is bad for my tweeting habits. I make good decisions! I&#8217;ve been too sick to write. Good job, me. And I just came up with an awesome title for a tattooists.</p>

    <p>Still a bit behind, but I&#8217;ll catch up tonight!! hit 20,000 words and I&#8217;m feelin awesome, think that i should make writing my career! This is so difficult omg whyyyyyy am I doing this agaaaiiinnnnn?!&#8230; Aaargh, I&#8217;m a mere 350 words away from 25,000!! Despite all my fears and doubts, this is going not too badly. I&#8217;ve showered, done dishes, and consumed three fucking delicious tacos.</p>

    <p>You must think me mad! I was too sick to write&#8230; I&#8217;m going to get it while the getting is good! I will take that as an awesome start to my day!</p>

    <p>I just opened my novel after two days &quot;sick leave. That was an awesome sprint for me. WHY OH WHY AM I BEHIND!!! And I hope he lets us win. Currenty sitting at 25,073 words and I am happy!</p>

    <p>After a refuel of roast chicken and rice, I made my today&#8217;s target of 40,000 words! 700 words ahead of where I planned to be, that&#8217;s what I call a successful night! I wanted to do it in 14 days, but 16 days is still impressive. I&#8217;m literally yelling at my characters for being stupid. I&#8217;m literally still screaming with happiness! :D Nichelle_Rae is my site profile!</p>

    <p>I think I made myself sick. Awesome writing day and I&#8217;m not even done. It hates me and I hate it. I&#8217;m really proud of all the progress!</p>

    <p>I hate when I come to a spot in writing where I&#8217;m blocked on what happens in one paragraph, but not for page upon page after it. Stupid flu symptoms making my head stuffy. Some of my best ideas come while driving&#8230; The best advice I&#8217;ve found is to ignore all advice.</p>

    <p>Cheering for my awesome antagonist. I wrote 1,352 words in 30 min this morning, which is the best I&#8217;ve ever done! I was so disappointed. I hate you. What I hate : my followers leave to support the editing.</p>

    <p>I hate that I need to go to bed. That was an awesome sprint for me.</p>

    <p>I am honestly shocked I&#8217;m still on track&#8230; I&#8217;d tell you about it, but I don&#8217;t want you to hate me, fellow NaNoWriMoers. I&#8217;m proud!</p>

    <p>So I came up with The Best Plan to deal with my inappropriate issues. I know I&#8217;m gonna win this! But my characters are definitely stupid. Crap I&#8217;m stuck&#8230; I&#8217;m bloody insane.</p>

    <p>Doing my best to catch up! I don&#8217;t know if I can sleep, I&#8217;m so excited!!!!! And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s all crap. Week two slump :(I feel like stopping!</p>

    <p>It feels like a never ending wasteland :(I can&#8217;t wait to be in the 30ks! I hate flashbacks. I think &#8220;Et voila, instabffls&#8221; is probably one of the best things I&#8217;ve ever written in a character bio. Shall try my best to get there. Be awesome if I could crack 20,000 words.</p>

    <p>Whatever you do, I&#8217;m proud of you!! It&#8217;s a good thing I&#8217;m sitting at 34K! Procrastination how do I hate thee? The word counting is driving me insane! I need to figure out the worst thing my FMC&#8217;s ever done (not murder).</p>

    <p>Even if I don&#8217;t reach wordcount today, thats still awesome. I&#8217;m so happy I could cry! I&#8217;m at that point in writing a novel where you just think it&#8217;s terrible and want to give up. The worst thing is that I can write whatever I want.</p>

    <p>That&#8217;s how I get my best stuff. :(However, I&#8217;m crazy close to 22K! Despite feeling horrible and dealing with a headache, I got my writing done today.</p>

    <p>I am beginning to find myself exceedingly annoying. This has been my best day yet. After I&#8217;m boring and go to work, that is. Lol I&#8217;m also at 32k words so close to finishing! I think Reanne is my favorite charecter EVER!!!!!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m going to do terrible things to you. This is the best set up I&#8217;ve ever written. Writing my character&#8217;s recuperation is boring. Hit twenty thousand words and I&#8217;m feeling awesome!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m so proud of everyone! If you need to kill a character, I have the perfect murder : eat roasted garlic hummus and breathe on them. Ttown is insane so I am in you today! I am a pathetic lump. I just realized a horrible event I&#8217;d planned is about to happen to my MC and I feel so horrible about it.</p>

    <p>Horrible confession of the day : Sometimes I purposely leave compounds unhyphenated&#8230; The best thing about writing a novel is that I can write whatever I want. I&#8217;ve discovered after some trial and error, i seem to do my best writing between 10pm and 3am. That was an awesome sprint for me. Not having the greatest day, but I broke 20k!</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m going to do terrible things to you. I am an evil, evil man. I&#8217;m participating as a&#8217; cheater&#8217; and proud of it! &quot; Despite my best efforts to suppress them, the words lay just below the surface,</p>

    <p>On my way to San Francisco for Night Of Writing Dangerously!!!!! I feel terrible. If I can get it to 85k by the end of the month, I win! Writing tip : Often as I type, I know it&#8217;s terrible but I won&#8217;t interrupt the stream. Why does the perfect sentence come to me the moment after I put shampoo in my hair?</p>
