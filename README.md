=============

project for DariusK's National Novel Generation Month: https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014/

This stuff uses the pattern library from http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pattern - really simple twitter scraping and linguistic analysis!

* wrimo-titler.py: Can't think of a title for your novel? Let wrimo-titler steal one for you. Searches twitter for people posting title ideas for #nanowrimo and extracts the ideas. Sample run:

```
Here's your title - choose one:
"How to Find a Husband"
"Double-Edged Sword"
"Justice for Katie"
"Promises Made/Debts Paid."
"You can't write if you can't relate."
"Infinite Sky"
"character listing"
"Main Title"
```
