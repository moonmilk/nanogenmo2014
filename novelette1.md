Welp, seriously think I'm gonna have problems getting to 50K with this story alone... I've been handwriting my notes the past few days. I'm SO hungry! I have pjs on and earplugs in and manuscript open. " "Nothing, my dear Frodo. Today I managed 2509.

I can see 25,000 by bed time! This happens once before I write a chapter. I have a goal for the end of this book, you are not included ma'am. Now I can veg out for a bit. I have to hit 25,000 words by tomorrow. Now I gonna go collapse... The emotion returned, and guided me. Managed to get my daily target WC in before midnight. This has been a strange week but I am still up to 35800 words. Procrastinated for half the day and now I'm about halfway through today's goal. I just thought if anyone saw my internet search history, I could be in trouble. Not sure how I feel about this... I am a mean, mean, mean writer person. I'm still 6,000 words behind but making small bits of progress!

Still behind but at least I reached the 20,000 mark. Not goin 2 b negative, I can do it. It's not a month of novelling madness if I don't break out the Atonement soundtrack for a few days of writing.

Broke 19K last night, and writing is getting easier though my schedule is not.

I'm like 10k behind, so I've got some serious making up to do. I just wrote like 639 in less than 20 minutes!!! Still a little behind but I'll get there. I just missed adding my total in before midnight, so it thinks I'm behind, but I'm not! Only 10K words so I'm behind schedule. Half way home and my pager still blowing up. I literally lost about 500 words today due to a massive plot change. Alright I'm on a push for the next two hours. Determined to get 2,000 words before I have to go out tonight. All my words are still there after the reboot and updates. I'm clearing the decks. My novel just turned into a thriller like I wanted, but couldn't manage! I didn't know it was going to get this deep. I have a sore wrist from overuse. I hit a wall at 22,000 words. I don't know what I'm writing but it will definitely be made out of words.

I'm not sure what's wrong with me.

For my characters' sake I must intercede! Now I have to go peel some eggs. Now I have to play Magnum PI in the background on Netflix to honor Glen A. Larson. I need alcohol. Which means I just need to write about twenty thousand words today to catch up. Did I say 2,847? I wrote 1698 words today and I have 22,165 total. I've sidetracked myself with this subplot.

Last year I had to write 8K words on the November 30th. I made it! I wish my derriere was big so I didn't have to work on my novel.

I've been hard on myself for falling behind, but I wrote over 25,000 words in two weeks, and that deserves a FUCK YEAH GO ME! Which (for me) is next to impossible. Last 1K I wrote, however, is deeply weird. You're running round in circles, calling out my name... Not much more before I'll be back on schedule. I wish fall could be here to stay forever. I lost the tiara. Is it just me or are these revisions taking FOREVER to get through?? Today I passed the word count I ended with for last year's NaNo. I have now surpassed 40k words. Ending my procrastination. I'm not bragging I swear! I'm trying to figure it out. I need a name for a disgraced, drunken lieutenant. '' I think nothing will be spared.

## Chapter 7 ##

On track to break my goal of 100,000 words this month. Now I want cake. And my time. I'm on fire! I should be going for halfway but given the exhaustion and frustration of my life...5k beats giving up completely. I wanna see high counts. I need rest, the spririt is willing, but my hands are spongy and bruised. I am excited about my most recent scene. Conflict of dates, had to make certain my story fit time frame. I am seriously having the best day of writing since day 1. Another 800 and I'll by at the 15k mark, which seems significant.

I'm running out of synonyms for deformed... Now I get to go do some yoga and catch up on Agents of Shield! For NaNo, I'm attempting to crank out an anthology. Maybe I'll try this approach again tomorrow! But I am now working on finishing this novel. I'm not super super far ahead but I'm not behind either. It would be so much easier if there were three of me. ONLY 800 MORE WORDS UNTIL I MEET MY FIRST GOAL! I'd call it a success. I've just reached my first 50k words! I've got a mug full of tea and 7000 words to catch up. I'm really excited about this project.

I just figured out what Part 2 will entail and I am so excited to watch it unfold. I think that's good enough. I love that moment when something new in the story clicks. Not as much as I wanted, but good enough to sleep on it! I can catch up, right? I stopped at exactly 40k words tonight. Ugh, Just reread my hook chapter and realized that it is a reasonable scenario for 49 states. Not that I'm anywhere near halfway done with my novel. still behind but I'm catching up. I'm sipping wine and reading a book. My 5 y.o. daughter told me : "Mom, I'm going to be a writer like you when I grow up. I'm at 17,666 words when I should be at 23,333. That was last week and I forgot to throw it away. I Rock! THIS is the book I've been trying to write for a year now. Oh my god.

listening to "I Know Places" by Tswift while my characters are running from robots. I am at 40K words! I did it. Pausing in my current crawl to eat lunch. I can't believe it. I have finally figured out the conflict of my novel! I'm nearly caught up. I've written all the exciting parts of my story, now I just need to fill in the gaps.I'm low on inspiration. Thank you very much constipation advert, ruining my train of thought in my chapter. What if everytime I would breathe, 1,500 words appear on the screen, That would be a pretty useful super power right now. When I believe I'm writing it for me and only me, it's always better! My greatest failure as a writer may be the inability to hang on to a flash drive to save my life. Really pleased I managed to do this much! I celebrated by eating too many golden Oreos and ribbon candy.

But I'm going to, because I'm a fucking professional. I'm stopping in the middle of a good part so I can pick it right up tomorrow. And I'm having so much fun, too! Lovin' the chapter I'm on, and still super excited about this story. That's exactly what my story needs. I've got an amnesiac telepath being hunted by clockwork wolves. I feel energized. Tomorrow is a big writing day for me! I am in Starbucks! That 25k badge coming up is my only motivation right now. I just finished writing the most intense part of my novel. Guess I should be happy I don't have to choose between two equally shitty lines.

This is my public promise to write 1000 words before doing anything else once I wake up tomorrow. I have been working on my novel for the last six hours and I literally cannot stop. Thank you brain for working while I slept. Basically I'm writing about writing. Take my hand and we'll make it I swear... After I put my laundry away, I am FINALLY start writing. Maybe I can do it? If I type nonstop? Who thinks I am capable of bullshitting 9.5K of words today without any actual plot to work on? Just hit 10,000 for the second time...which is halfway to where I should be right now. Not my best in terms of daily word count but I'm finally getting my groove back. Pretty sure a bit of the 2k that I wrote today is more of an info dump (and less of a book), but this is so much fun! Today my writing goal is 3 days worth of word counts. Hopefully I can work just as quick before the gym this evening. 30k in and I've changed and moved around so much on my original outline that now it resembles a football play chart. I'm unbelievably excited. I love it when a writing session, which started out rocky, turns into a success.

I'm officially halfway there! I'm full of encouragement today. This is huge for me. Lucky for me I was well ahead. my simplified character and conflict formula : what does he want? I can haz GPS? I'm not sure what to do with a first draft that's not begging to be written. Will I try? I made this guy in novel drive somewhere and then drink. Does it count as a sex scene if my character is getting off on murdering a room full of murder fetishists? I'll be fine.

I should try to churn out 3k tomorrow as well so that I get ahead of the curve again. 1700 words at lunchtime brings me to par for today. Well, maybe I can use this time I unexpectedly have to try to get the day's quota written before everyone comes home! Not getting any writing done right now because SS4 exists and I'm watching footie. I'm still way behind, but making progress and it feels great! Too much fun playing with "Ginnie me! I'm over 21K! I'll have to power through tomorrow to beat you. I'm eating Pudding with a fork. Everything I try to do... I can see the completion of the 1st draft of my 1st novel on the horizon! One of my favorite issues of the past year! :) I'm currently working on Snow. Here's a fun experiment : I have no idea what this scene will accomplish or how it will play out, but I'm just gonna press PLAY. But I'm excited.

Today is my day for getting back on track! I just put my headphones on so I wouldn't disturb the cat. He'll thank me later, right? I think it's worth it. Do I think logically that I will be able to hit 20K today? Looking at what I'm going to write today and lulzing at myself. I've topped 30,000 words now and I'm like, How am I going to end this with just 20k words left? I'm at just over 19k. It's been 21k words since my last chapter break. I am DOING it! Now, if only I had artistic talent... I just had an exciting jail break with explosions. Regaining my comfortable groove.

I'm feeling pretty good about moving forward now. I had to move into the livingroom and light the fireplace. OK, I'm ready to write. I love writing new fiction first thing in the morning. No words so far today, but my garage has a floor for the first time in years! So one of my characters, who is already in a relationship, is sorta flirting with another character. Partly because of home issues, partly because the YA idea I had needs help with the voice. I'm going to write like a maniac tonight. I've decided November will my month of decadent indulgence. I am. But to do it all I a smartphone.... I just can't make myself write! Around 4500 words in the race to catch up, and feel I'm creeping closer...but not today. Well, I didn't see that coming.

Do you think I can do? I don't fee like writing today. I wrote 1686 train words!!! It's 10 pm and I need to go to bed in 30 minutes due to an early morning.

I'm not proud about my word count, but I'm proud about not having given up. Wonder if I can knock out 3K to break 30K? I think you've just invented a "thing. I AM SUCH A SLACKER. Can I get a WHOOP! "...And miles to go before I sleep. Kickin ass on my word count today! I wrote 8924 words on Day 12! it's very unlike my usual stuff.
